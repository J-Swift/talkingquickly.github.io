Personal summary of <https://www.saastr.com/saastr-podcast-380-with-truework-co-founder-and-ceo-ryan-sandler/>

Jeff wiener book on management, compassionate leader 

Always want to be Enterprise and SME, mid market is often overlooked. Mid market 500-2000 relatively similar to enterprise in terms of need, but much faster sales cycle.

Product must add value at the start, but selling the gaps and future features is also important early on

Talks about security certifications a lot 

Where people fall down; not understanding procurement process and decision makers etc 

Enterprise all want; SSO, RBAC, change management; audit logs etc 

Generally selling add ons is much easier than rip and replace. Eventually can get to rip and replace after you’re adding value

Pricing; start high, really high, they’ll tell you it’s out of budget. But want to have these conversations late, eg demonstrate value first, might well be third or fourth calls before talking about pricing to avoid burning lead.

Case studies and webinars are good, any opportunity to have customers talking for you 

SEO best kept secret in SaaS creates high barriers to entry and effects are compounding.

Head terms “eg software reviews” tail terms eg “salesforce software reviews “ 

Eg they spun up 10’s of thousands of pages for tail terms like “Facebook employment verification” where head term is “employment verification” ranked one for these very quickly

A lot of their product strategy was how to build directory to rank for many terms. So there is no content team, it’s all fully automated. 

## Own Research

He's talking about pages like this (random selection, CSV of top 100 attached):

- https://www.truework.com/verifications/fedex-employment-verification/
- https://www.truework.com/verifications/u-haul-employment-verification/
- https://www.truework.com/verifications/cracker-barrel-employment-verification/

So essentially the product is verifying employment at particular companies, e.g. "did person X i want to hire work at company Y" so they're taking all of the big employers in the US (the possible company Y's) and generating a page which is just a generic description of that company (from what I've seen this is primarily a slightly re-worded version of the first 3 paragraphs of the companies wikipedia page) followed by a paragraph about what they do and how they can help.
