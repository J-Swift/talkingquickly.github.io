# 053 - Assessing Product MArket Fit and Why Customer Segmentation is Crucial

Primary role of early sales team especially customer success is feeding info back to product team.

The founders are the first sales people; meeting over if founders not doing first sales.

First two sales rep generally younger scrappy and often won't be the same people who will be good later

When assessing PM fit at v early stage, e.g. only 1-5 customers etc then will talk to early customers and assess; how big is problem, is it worth solving; how else have they tried to solve it; how much value is lost in current approaches.

Will ask them things like; what are the top three things product does for you, what isnâ€™t it doing, where are you importing or exporting data from the product.

1.0 much harder than 2.0. Org will have a handful of people who can do the 1.0, and 5-10x the number that can do the 2.0. Qualitative questions are hard, once in market and moving, much easier.

If can tell sales rep how to qualify customer, eg forward leaning backward leaning size sector buyer persona other systems etc and rep can then close them, then probably have product market fit. Product market fit is repeatability.

Customer persona's incredibly important, one or two or three, who did we build release for. Say to sales if you find customer who looks like this, close them.

Biggest advice; keep asking "who did you build this product for"
