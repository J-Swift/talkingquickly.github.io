        <h1 class="post-title">Startup Reading List (2018 Edition)</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Something most of the startup and product people I look up to have in common is that they read, a lot. They also challenge what they read. Rather than reading a chapter, then immediately trying to implement what they&#39;ve read, their books are full of post-it notes and scribbles, dinners and emails are full of debates on one methodology or idea v another.</p>

<p>Each has their own constantly evolving approach, but it&#39;s one developed with the benefit of the learnings from many hundreds of other people. This reading list is the books and articles which I return to most frequently which have had the biggest impact on my approach.</p>

<h2>General &quot;Startups&quot;</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2ka2IH0">Founders Stories</a>. Insightful series of interviews covering everything from unexpected pivots to the impact startups have on your personal life.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2BxKUty">Zero To One</a>. Find an important truth not many people agree with you on, aim to build a monopoly business based on that truth. And make sure you nail Sales, Marketing, Hiring etc while you&#39;re at it.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2ByT5Ge">High Output Management</a>. One of the best books on management I&#39;ve come across. Heavy focus on a managers output being a leveraged function of his direct reports. So to maximise this output, must maximise ability of direct reports to produce output. </li>
<li><a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">How to get startup ideas</a>. Don&#39;t look for &quot;startup ideas,&quot; Look for problems which need solving, which you care about being solved</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2k8bRjo">Anything you want</a>. Everything should be about customers, good ideas don&#39;t feel special, they feel like common sense that no-one else gets. If you create a business you get to write the rules, make sure they&#39;re the ones you actually want.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2BxcnM1">Making Ideas Happen</a>. Very practical advice on moving from &quot;here&#39;s an idea&quot; to actually doing something. Arguably more of a productivity book but essential in unstructured environments like startups.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2kb2KOU">The art of the start</a>. Another really practical look at actually making things happen rather than just talking about them.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2BtbKD3">Smart and gets things done</a>. Focused on hiring developers but applicable generally, clues in the title, &quot;good&quot; people to hire are smart and get stuff done, the book focuses on how to identify these traits.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Product Development &amp; Product Management</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2kauV0g">The Four Steps to the Epiphany</a>. The original and most comprehensive book on the &quot;lean&quot; approach to startups and product development. </li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2Bm6G2w">Lean Startup</a> (first half). The most accessible and widely read introduction to the &quot;lean&quot; approach to startups and product development. Gets a bit repetitive towards the end.</li>
<li><a href="https://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/">Good product manager bad product manager</a>. Caveatted with a warning by the author that it was written over 15 years ago but I still think one of the best quick-reads on what&#39;s important from a product manager.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2kbb411">Thinking fast and slow</a>. One of the most comprehensive introductions to psychological biases, how people think and why people often don&#39;t behave rationally. </li>
<li><a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">Do things that don&#39;t scale</a>. The initial push that makes startups take off is almost always hugely unscalable. This isn&#39;t a bad thing.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">Makers Schedule, Managers Schedule</a>. Makers and Managers are doing fundamentally different things which require different ways of working. Don&#39;t fall into the trap of imposing manager ways of working on makers.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@dunn/get-one-thing-right-89390244c553">Get one thing right</a>. Descriptions in the title.</li>
<li><a href="https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2">How you know you&#39;re in a feature factory</a>. There&#39;s nothing worse than feeling like you&#39;re churning out features without any real understanding of whether they &quot;worked&quot; and what impact they had on the business. It&#39;s also painfully easy to fall into. Helpful warning signs to look out for.</li>
<li><a href="https://hitenism.com/amazon-working-backwards/">Working backwards</a>. In the AWS product team, Amazon write the press release, then the manual, then the spec. Defining the end goal first helps focus everything else.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/beat-the-feature-factory-run-pre-cap-design-studios-725d1c83ecd7">Using design studios to beat the feature factory</a>. Similar to the Amazon &quot;press release first&quot; approach but more actionable in smaller organizations. Design the retrospective slide first.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2k9Pfiy">Hooked - How to Build Habit Forming Products</a> (the first few chapters). This book can get somewhat repetitive but a good look at the principles underlying addictive products and how to leverage this.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Big Picture</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2Bwyu5h">The master algorithm</a>. The single best book on approaches to machine learning / artificial intelligence I&#39;ve encountered. It&#39;s easy to become skeptical with everyone throwing the term &quot;AI&quot; around. This is the book which made me want to get involved with it again.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2kb3MdK">The Hard Thing about Hard Things</a>. Drives home that fundamentally there can&#39;t be a &quot;playbook&quot; for solving hard problem x, because it&#39;s never been solved before. Filled with advice and practical experience for how to handle that. </li>
</ul>

<h2>General &quot;Life&quot;</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2BlfFRq">Fooled by Randomness</a>. Humans tend to see patterns everywhere, even where there aren&#39;t any. Lots of examples of where this tends to happen, how it messes with our decision making and what to do about it. Probably the single book that&#39;s had the biggest impact on how I think about the world.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2BwRSyZ">The Four Hour Work Week</a>. Initially dismissed this book for the spammy title. When I eventually read it found it densely packed with actionable information about how to allocate time and what conventional business &amp; financial wisdom should be considered harmful. Also strongly recommend the weekly <a href="https://tim.blog/podcast/">Tim Ferris Podcast</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2k9UzSU">Elon Musk (Biography)</a>. Whatever you think about the guy, he seems to ship a lot of stuff...</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2k6AOeS">Surely you&#39;re Joking Mr Feynman</a>. The definition of a curious mind, truly amazing man and life.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2BxtcpV">How to win friends and influence people</a>. Still the definitive guide to improving  people skills.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2BxcZ4h">Getting Things Done</a>. I&#39;ve never met anyone who actually follows the fiendishly complicated ToDo list system Dave Allen suggests here. But it contains pretty much all the building blocks you&#39;ll ever need to come up with a task tracking system which suits you.</li>
<li><a href="http://casnocha.com/2010/05/50-ways-to-expose-yourself-to-randomness.html">How to expose yourself to randomness</a>. Most big things have a huge &quot;luck&quot; component, being exposed to randomness a lot dramatically increases the odds of being lucky.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/">How to be an early riser</a>. Something <em>most</em> successful people seem to have in common is getting up early, being a morning person is definitely learnable.</li>
</ul>
