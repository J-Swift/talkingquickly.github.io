<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>

<p>This assumes you have CLI access to a Kubernetes cluster, will be working in a namespace called <code>identity</code> and have both Helm 3 and Kubectl installed and working locally. Finally it assumes that you're using <a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/">NGINX for Ingress</a> along with cert manager for SSL certificates with a Cluster Issuer called <code>letsencrypt-production</code>.</p>

<p>If your configuration is different, the majority of the steps will be the same, but you'll need to change the ingress annotations accordingly.</p>
