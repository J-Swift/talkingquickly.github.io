          <p> 
          I'm a Ruby Developer, lover of good coffee and making things. I'm the author of <a href="https://leanpub.com/deploying_rails_applications" target="_blank">Reliably Deploying Rails Applications</a> and currently based in London. Fairly serious travel addiction so often exploring the rest of Europe or trying to visit every American State at least once. <a href= "http://www.twitter.com/talkingquickly" target="_blank">@talkingquickly</a> on twitter.
