        <h1 class="post-title">Ben Dixon - CV</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>I&#39;m a senior Ruby/ Rails &amp; Android developer, also proficient in several other languages, I&#39;ve written production code in Ruby, Java, Javascript, Python, Go, .NET and PHP.</p>

<p>I believe in shipping new features quickly and regularly but without compromising on code quality or test coverage. I generally give greater weight to integration tests than unit tests but see the importance of both.</p>

<p>I primarily work with startups or small companies. Over the last 8 years I&#39;ve worked as both a contractor and on several startups of my own. I&#39;m the author of &quot;Reliably Deploying Rails Applications&quot; and spoke at Railsconf in 2014 on deployment and in 2015 on integrating Docker with Rails.</p>

<p>I have a technical blog at <a href="http://www.talkingquickly.co.uk">www.talkingquickly.co.uk</a> where I primarily write about Rails and Docker.</p>

<p>Outside of work I like to climb and travel. I write about travel at <a href="http://www.talkingquickly.co.uk/travel">www.talkingquickly.co.uk/travel</a>.</p>
