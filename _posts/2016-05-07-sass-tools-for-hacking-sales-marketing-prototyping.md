There's nothing quite like the mixture of joy and fury that goes with someone telling you there's a twenty dollar SaaS product out there which entirely automates the process which has taken up weeks of your precious time to date.

Joy that your work just became so much more efficient, fury that you didn't know this months ago.

With the right tools it's possible to prototype, test or automate almost anything without writing - or knowing how to write - a single line of code.
