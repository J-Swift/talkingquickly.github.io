Failing Hard in Hungary

The encounter with Hungary's healthcare system had already made the trip somewhat exciting. It seems that Budapest was not yet done toying with us.

On returning from another excellent night in the ruin bars, I discovered my combination lock had been forced. Missing were a Macbook, Kindle, Phone Charger and External Battery. Bugger.

With the help of the hostel staff we pieced together what had happened. A gentleman had checked in for just one night, waited until everyone went out for the night and then forced the lock and left immediately.

Even more galling we knew exactly who it was. We'd been worried nobody was talking to him so offered him coffee and later chatted to him a bit further in the rooom before leaving for the night.

Having things stolen is an accepted risk of travelling, it happens to everyone eventually. There is however something unpleasant about the idea that somebody can sit and make conversation with the people they later plan to steal from.

Luckily our thieving friend has not yet mastered his profession. Whilst he got the laptop, charger and all other cables, he somehow he missed the camera. Silver Linings.

It's a tribute to how wonderful Budapest is that despite these events, it's still by far my favourite city yet.

I was lucky enough to be in the company of some wonderful individuals who helped calm me down - my initial reaction was nowhere near as laissez faire as this post suggests. Thanks to them the final few days in Budapest were relaxing and cocktail filled. 

The most frustrating part of all is that it could probably have been avoided were I using a better quality lock. I'd switched to a lightweight combination lock because I didn't want to risk losing the key to the larger padlock whilst out.

After brief pit stop in London to replace the essentials and grab dinner at Duck and Waffle, I'm now off to Sofia to continue the trip. With a much bigger lock.
