For the last month, I've been writing code on 3 x 40" monitors from an alpine lodge, a space station and sometimes, floating in space surrounded by stars. This is all thanks to a combination of an Oculus Quest 2 and Immersed VR, with a few networking upgrades and a touch typing refresher thrown in for good measure.

tldr; with the increased resolution of the Quest 2, this is now a viable option.
