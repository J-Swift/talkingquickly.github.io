Stuff to remember about deploying:

* have to go through distillery init process
* have to set `server: true` in prod config
* To connect to stuff and do stuff once it's up and running use; /app/_build/prod/rel/candidate_funnel/bin/candidate_funnel remote_console
* Need to set tag and image if using generic helm chart
