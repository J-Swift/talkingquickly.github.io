Working while you travel has many upsides. Trips can be far longer because there's money coming in, you meet some fascinating people in co-working spaces and it can often be quite nice to take a break from sight seeing to sink your teeth into a challenging problem. Working as a developer however requires carrying around some expensive hardware, my initial "working while travelling" kit required a US3000 laptop, an iPad and a US1000 phone.

<!--more-->

Because the risks of theft are high and the items are expensive, most travel insurance companies will refuse to cover them. For example I've been unable to find a company that will insure an individual item worth more than ~US1000.

This can play on your mind. My time in Crabby, Thailand was a disaster for several reasons, but a substantial part of it was being unable to do many things because I was too concerned to leave the development kit unattended.

This somewhat defeats the purpose of travelling while working, if the risk of theft means doing nothing but commuting between a co-working space and a hostel, there's little benefit in the enterprise.

This topic is now particularly important to me as in Budapest I was robbed, Macbook, Kindle and various other bits of kit, gone in a night. The immediate implications of this were:

* I was completely unable to work for the remainder of the week, had a client had an emergency, I would have struggled to assist
* A substantial financial loss, nothing will be covered by insurance
* Having to immediately change all plans to get back to London and re-group
* An unpleasent emotional impact as a result of both the financial loss, concern about clients and knowing I had to re-plan my trip

Before continuing the trip therefore, each of these problems need addressing in turn;

## Being unable to work

Without the laptop I was unable to work and had no access to the remote servers I administer. This meant both lost income and had the potential for loss of faith from clients.

The solution to this has several stages:

* An Ubuntu based development environment on a USB key. This will include an encrypted persistent partition with key data on it as well as a basic development toolchain for both Rails and Android. This can be booted on any laptop, either borrowed from a hostel or purchased locally.
* A remote VPS setup with a Rails development environment and an exact copy of the vim based setup I use for Rails locally. Much like this iPad based development setup.

## Financial Loss

The switch to an Ubuntu based development environment above also removes the need to travel with expensive Apple hardware.

Whilst I'll probably always continue to use a Macbook whilst I'm in any one city for a long period, whilst travelling, there's no reason not to use the Ubuntu based setup on much cheaper hardware.

This post is being written on a < US1000 Core i5 with 8GB RAM running Ubuntu 15.04 which is performing admirably.

## Having to adjust plans

The far less expensive hardware means that everything I'm travelling with will be covered by insurance.

In the event anything is stolen again, it can be replaced immediately, the Ubuntu based development environment restored and the cost claimed on insurance later.

## Emotional Impact

It was bad realising how much the theft was going to cost me, it was worse realising that I was at risk of letting my clients down.

The steps above mean that the financial impact of the event re-ocurring will be minimal. In the event that it does, the impact on my ability to continue working will be almost zero.

## Minimising the Risk

Mitigating the result of a theft is one thing, I'd still rather not be robbed at all.

There's no escaping the fact that if I'd been using a better quality lock, this may never have happened. In future I'll be using something like this:

@TODO

And be sticking more strictly to my rule of minimising the amount of time I use the laptop in the hostel, especially in hostels where it's easy for people to see which room I then take it in to.
