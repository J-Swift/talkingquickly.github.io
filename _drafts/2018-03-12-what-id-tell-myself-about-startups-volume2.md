In April 2015 I wrote "What I'd tell myself about startups if I could go back 5 years". Off the back of nearly 1000 upvotes on Hacker News, a day on the front page of /r/entrepreneurship, being re-published by Business Insider and distributed in the Mattermark Daily, it's by far the most read thing I've ever written with over @todo having read it over the last three years.

It was through that post I met Oli and Steffen, my now co-founders at Catapult. Since then we've raised over £5m in investment, changed the way thousands of people work across retail and hospitality and had the privilege of hiring some truly exceptional individuals.

Up until Catapult my experience was primarily in bootstrapped businesses, so three years in, there have been a fair few more lessons learned. The usual caveats apply, this isn't advice, just what I'd tell myself, the "you" here is me, writing is still hard.

1) The single hardest thing to get right remains not building too much, too soon. This gets exponentially harder the more people involved

1) Once there are lots of people involved, brute force won't work for "saying no to features," you need buy in from all stakeholders. Lots of examples from other respected product led companies helps here

1) You need to have a very clear separation between "don't build too much" and "building only what *you* think is right". If there is a perception you're doing the latter, (2) will become almost impossible

1) Scoring systems are *invaluable* for getting buy in from larger teams about why some things are being built but others aren't. If you don't want to design your own, RICE is a good, simple starting point

1) Scoring systems are, in general, amazing tools for forcing structured, critical thinking and aligning stakeholders. But always be clear upfront that they're just tools, the "highest score" doesn't always "win"

1) Really good visual design *does matter*, hire a designer significantly earlier than you intuitively think you should

1) Visual design and UX are not at all the same, people who are good at both are awesome. Be clear which you're hiring for and interview accordingly

1) Hiring smart people you trust and empowering to make decisions themselves is the single highest leverage thing you can do as a founder, [High Output Management](@todolink) by Andy Grove of IBM fame is an excellent book on this topic

1) Unstructured interviews where you're just "getting a feel for candidate" don't work. Go in having read the CV with a clear list of things you want to understand at the end of it. Otherwise you're wasting your time and theirs

1) Have a clear scoring matrix for each role your interviewing for, some standard categories and some role specific ones seems to work well. Everyone involved in the interview process should participate in scoring. You don't have to hire the highest scoring person, but the process forces structured merits based conversations

1) If you interview someone and it's a maybe, then it's a no

1) People very rarely turn it around, "fire fast" sounds like a soulless cliché but is probably good advice

1) When hiring, don't underestimate how important peoples ability to communicate with empathy is. This is one of the hardest things to teach, or at least I don't yet have a good way

1) Watching how people deal with those who are junior or they perceive as junior to them is a *very* good way of assessing how well they work with people in general. Bossiness, rudeness or a lack of self awareness should raise serious red flags

1) Firing fast doesn't mean firing unexpectedly, feedback in the first one to three months should be regular and very honest. If in doubt be overly blunt, "at the moment X,Y,Z is good but A,B,C is not where we'd like it to be," then have regular conversations about A, B and C

1) It's painfully easy to make yourself a blocker. Once you've hired said smart people who you trust to make decisions, be brutally honest with yourself about whether you're really delegating enough decision making power to them

1) Hiring smart people and then micro-managing them is pretty much the worst thing you can do

1) Be especially aware of making yourself a blocker in things you enjoy. Think early about how to reduce the bus factor and split decision making in these areas

1) As the team grows, it becomes much harder for everyone to stay in touch with what's happening across the business. Constantly experiment with ways to mitigate this. Periodic dinners where lots of people give updates as well as announcement only slack channels seem to work quite well

1) If you're going to need VC funding, don't underestimate the value of a "VC Proxy" who can give you insights into what numbers and parts of the story VC's will care about at which stage

1) Regularly re-visit which numbers are going to be on an investor deck in six months time, because six months time will be too late to make them better

1) Understand which roles it's essential for people to "know their numbers" and make sure they understand this. Empower them by removing barriers to them accessing and manipulating data themselves

1) The numbers in an investor deck in six months should be the same as the ones department heads are being measured on which in turn should be the core numbers which drive your financial model. If these differ for a significant period, somethings up

1) A smart person focussing exclusively on BI is incredibly valuable. So is teaching smart people SQL and giving them access to some sort of data warehouse

1) Data warehouses are a thing. It (probably) just means "big ole database". With tools like Panoply and @TODO marketing tool it's possible to get almost anything into a standard database (Jira, Zendesk, Adwords spend, Facebook spend, Mixpanel, you name it). Then you can build dashboards with Metabase or Chartio. Then you can measure it properly

1) If your pitch deck has more than 20 slides, it's probably worth having another think about it

1) Have zero tolerance of time-sinks like recurring unstructured catch ups and goal-less meeting. Meetings that begin with a clear agenda / goal will generally be useful, those that don't will generally be a waste of everyone's time

1) Nobody can productively work 12 hour days for a pro-longed period. Lean towards being intolerant of those who highly value "first in, last out" type behaviour. Consistently long hours lead to low quality work output and burn out

1) That doesn't mean never work late. "Crunch Time" is a real thing and people should be aware of this and embrace it when they join. But regular multi month or multi year "crunch times" are just bad resource management

1) Hire developers who love to ship and have a track record of shipping. When interviewing find out as much about what they've shipped and the trade-offs they had to consider to ship efficiently as you do about the technical side

1) Developers who love to ship aren't averse to new and shiny, but they assess the new-shiny in terms of how it will allow them to ship more

1) It's not wasted time to experiment with new shiny and then decide "this is great, but there's no business case here (_it won't really help us ship_), let's leave it for now"

1) Someone treating technical feedback as personal criticism is a red flag. Always approach this with empathy (imposter syndrome is a thing) but over the long term, do not allow this attitude in a team as it will stifle communication and innovation

1) Selective time taken to rip out and re-factor legacy code is time *very* well spent. Two years in, the increased shipping velocity this allows for will be a substantial competitive edge

1) Money spent on developer productivity is money well spent, in particular solid, fast CI

1) For sheer CI runner speed, few cloud options will compete with lots of cheap bare metal from the likes of Hetzner

1) Remote-first is pretty much a no-brainer for development teams but be very careful to over-communicate that the team is remote-first, not out-sourced when dealing with investors

1) The Daily Stoic is a great companion for dealing with the fact that at best, 90% of a start-up is by default outside of your control

1) Some sort of exercise regime which gives a sense of progression and achievement, for example running, is essential to counter the bad weeks

1) It's really worth persevering with some sort of mindfulness meditation, e.g. Headspace. But you need to stick to it for at least a month or so before you _really_ start to feel the benefits
