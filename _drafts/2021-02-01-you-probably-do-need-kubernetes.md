Threads which reference Kubernetes on Hacker News follow a fairly predictable path. The topic of using Kubernetes to deploy an application is raised and an avalanche of helpful commentors ride in to the rescue to explain to the hapless Kubernetes user that "you could achieve exactly the same thing with a VPS".

They are almost certainly correct, there are few if any web applications which before Kubernetes were impossible to deploy. Their argument however often holds a little more nuance, not just that it's possible, but that it would be simpler to deploy said application to Kubernetes.

This too, is very often true!
