            <p><p>One of the most high leverage tools available to us is habit. We are the sum of the things we do, our habits tend to be the things we do most and therefore we tend towards being the sum of our habits. Charles Duhigg&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-Habit-Why-What-Change/dp/1847946240">The Power of Habit</a> is a great primer on this. An interplay I&#39;m increasingly interested in is the one between habits and batching (or habits of batching).</p>

I can&#39;t claim to be exceptionally good at sticking to them. As per usual, the &quot;you&quot; here is me, this isn&#39;t advice, it&#39;s just what&#39;s worked for me whenever I&#39;ve managed to stick to it. It&#39;s definitely highly influenced by the dynamics of building technology companies and is very tailored to the quirks of my psyche, ymmv.</p>

Rather than reading a chapter, then immediately trying to implement what they&#39;ve read, their books are full of post-it notes and scribbles, dinners and emails are full of debates on one methodology or idea v another.</p>

            <p><p>May 2016 seems like a reasonable interval to have given 2015 to sink in. 2015 was expected to begin at a Full Moon Party on one or other island off the coast of Thailand. Instead it began with a hastily booked flight back to London and a week or so recovering from three days of hallucinations and dehydration on Aonang - they really do food poisoning properly there. Can&#39;t say I&#39;m proud for bailing due to food poisoning; live and learn.</p>

I might even remove it from my ToDo list where it&#39;s now the oldest item after returning the copy of &quot;Chaos&quot; I borrowed from a public library in my first year of university, six years of fines are going to hurt. In the spirit of <a href="">it probably isn&#39;t a big deal</a> I&#39;ll dive straight into 2014 but with a scattering of confusing references to 2013 for context.</p>

            <p><p>An EKG (electrocardiogram) - also referred to as an ECG - is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart. This can be used for measuring the rate and regularity of heart beats. Using a readily available Arduino shield, an Arduino and a $10 set of electrodes, it&#39;s possible to generate this waveform at home and then manipulate and plot it in realtime using Javascript.</p>

            <p><p>Having tried the Oculus I&#39;d prepared myself to be completely unimpressed by Google&#39;s $2 VR solution. But after trying Roller Coaster VR I was blown away by how well the slightly shabby looking cardboard assembly performed. Naturally despite never have tried any game development or 3D modeling, I wanted to make stuff for it. Using Unity and some plugins, this turned out to be surprisingly easy. This tutorial covers the bare minimum needed to go from never having used Unity before, to a simple 3D environment you can look around using Google Cardboard.</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p><p>If you use chef-solo to provision your production servers, Vagrant makes it easy to set up a production- like environment on a local VM for testing purposes. It can however seem like wasted time to have to manually replicate the contents of your node definition in your <code>Vagrantfile</code> and more importantly it&#39;s easy to make a change to either the <code>Vagrantfile</code> or the node definition and forget to update the other to match. In this post I&#39;ll look at a simple method of automatically generating Vagrant machines based on node definitions.</p>

            <p><p>Onboarding new developers to a Rails projects is still a far harder task than it should be. A big part of this is that setting up a development environment for an app or suite of apps, getting the correct ruby versions, database versions etc running locally, can in many cases take upwards of a day. A combination of Vagrant and Docker can make this a thing of the past.</p>

            <p><p>When deploying with Capistrano 3, it&#39;s often useful to be able to start a rails console without having to ssh into the target host and set it up manually. This can be particularly challenging if you&#39;re using rbenv as you have to ensure that <code>rails console</code> is called with suitable environment variables set set to ensure that the rbenv Ruby is used not the system Ruby.</p>
