        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p><p>One of the things VSCode has done extremely well is creating a seamless remote development experience. Using the remote extension pack, specifically the SSH development extension, it&#39;s possible to run VSCode locally, while performing all actions on a remote server completely seamlessly. This allows us to use a local VM for much faster docker development on macOS. It also means we are free to spin up powerful Cloud VM&#39;s with many cores and plenty of RAM when we&#39;re working on more intensive tasks.</p>

<p>With this setup I seamlessly switch between fully local development using a Virtualbox VM and a 16 core cloud VM with 64GB of RAM when I need more horsepower. In both environments this provides the level of Docker performance I associate with developing directly on Linux machines.</p>

<p>This is streamlined using an Ansible playbook which automatically sets up Debian VM&#39;s with sensible defaults for development, including a beautiful default ZSH configuration (inc auto-completions) and easy language version management with asdf. This post starts with the practical steps required for this setup, and then goes on to explain what&#39;s being installed and how it works.</p>

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p><p>SSH agent forwarding is kind of like magic. Say you&#39;re using VSCode remote development to develop on a remote VM and you want to pull from a private repository. By default you might either generate a new keypair on the remote machine and add them to Github. Or you might copy your existing private key to the remote development machine. The former is fiddly and the latter raises some security concerns. With SSH Agent Forwarding you can allow the remote machine to authenticate requests using the keys on your local machine, without the keys ever leaving your local machine.</p>

<p>One hiccup with this is that if you&#39;re a tmux user, you&#39;ll find that this works initially but then stops working in subsequent sessions. This post offers a simple solution to this.</p>

        </header>
        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p><p>Manual repetitive tasks are my nemesis and setting up a new Macbook from scratch is a prime example of this. Using Ansible we can completely automate this process. This is valuable both for individual efficiency and for facilitating standardised &quot;team setups&quot; so that new joiners avoid spending their first days googling obscure node version errors.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ansible.com">Ansible</a> is a tool most commonly associated with the setup of servers and infrastructure. But more broadly it&#39;s an excellent tool for automating the setup of any computer, including laptops and workstations. Of all the configuration management tools out there it&#39;s by far the easiest one to use - requiring no devops background at all - and has an amazing community supporting it.</p>

<p>This posts outlines the setup I&#39;ve evolved over the previous few years which means setting up a new Macbook pro for fairly broad development (Rails, Javascript, Elixir, Python, Android &amp; iOS) now takes just a couple of commands. This includes loading all my shell customisations and GUI apps like Chrome, Office, Virtualbox etc.</p>

            <p><p>A recent change to AWS NodeGroup behaviour means that some CloudFormation stacks which create EKS NodeGroups may start to fail with the error <code>Nodegroup the-nodegroup-name failed to stabilize: Internal Failure</code>.

As per usual, the &quot;you&quot; here is me, this isn&#39;t advice, it&#39;s just what&#39;s worked for me whenever I&#39;ve managed to stick to it.

But after trying Roller Coaster VR I was blown away by how well the slightly shabby looking cardboard assembly performed. Naturally despite never have tried any game development or 3D modeling, I wanted to make stuff for it. Using Unity and some plugins, this turned out to be surprisingly easy. This tutorial covers the bare minimum needed to go from never having used Unity before, to a simple 3D environment you can look around using Google Cardboard.</p>
