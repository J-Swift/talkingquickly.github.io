            <p><p>Onboarding new developers to a Rails projects is still a far harder task than it should be. A big part of this is that setting up a development environment for an app or suite of apps, getting the correct ruby versions, database versions etc running locally, can in many cases take upwards of a day. A combination of Vagrant and Docker can make this a thing of the past.</p>

        <section class="post-excerpt">
            <p><p>When deploying with Capistrano 3, it&#39;s often useful to be able to start a rails console without having to ssh into the target host and set it up manually. This can be particularly challenging if you&#39;re using rbenv as you have to ensure that <code>rails console</code> is called with suitable environment variables set set to ensure that the rbenv Ruby is used not the system Ruby.</p>

            <p><p>One of the most popular posts on this blog is on how to use Capistrano 2 to deploy Rails applications to a VPS, including the scenario when you want to run several different applications on the same server. Capistrano 3 has now been released and having upgraded several large production applications to use it, I&#39;ve found there to be a lot of worthwhile improvements over v2. This post explains, with sample code, how to use Capistrano 3 to deploy one or several Rails applications to a VPS.</p>

            <p><p>When deploying Rails Applications with Capistrano 2 it was common to

they could be viewed locally without sshing into the remote
