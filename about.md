title: About me 
---

My name's Ben Dixon, I'm a developer working primarily with Ruby on
Rails but also dabbling in C for hardware development using the Arduino and
more recently the Pebble Watch.

I'm the author of <a href="https://leanpub.com/deploying_rails_applications"
target="_blank">Reliably Deploying Rails Applications</a> which covers how
to deploy medium sized Rails Applications in an easy, scalable fashion.

I recently moved to Paris from London and am currently the technical lead at
Active In Time where among other things we make the <a
href="http://www.speedo.com/getspeedofit/getspeedofit_1/getspeedofitapp/gsfapplandingpage.html"
target="_blank">Speedo Fit</a> swimming
app and explore ways to make fitness more fun using technology.

Other projects include working as the software and embedded device developer behind the <a
href="http://www.mousemet.com/" target="_blank">Mousemet Electronic Von
Frey</a> and trying to work out what to do next with <a
href="http://www.shopofme.com" target="_blank">shop of me</a>.

I'm sometimes available for short pieces of contract development or
devops work and always interested in chatting to new
people. You can find me on twitter as <a
href="http://www.talkingquickly.co.uk"
target="_blank">@talkingquickly</a> or by emailing
<a href="mailto:ben@talkingquickly.co.uk" >ben@talkingquickly.co.uk</a>.
