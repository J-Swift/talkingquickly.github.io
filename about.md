title: About me 
---

My name's Ben Dixon, I'm a developer/ CTO focused on Ruby on Rails and iOS/ Android applications. I also have experience of front-end development in React and infrastructure management with Chef and Docker.

I co-founded the on-demand staffing platform <a href="https://www.joincatapult.com">Catapult</a> in 2015 which now provides staff to some of the UK's most prominent retail and hospitality businesses.

I'm the author of <a href="https://leanpub.com/deploying_rails_applications"
target="_blank">Reliably Deploying Rails Applications</a> which covers how
to deploy medium sized Rails Applications in an easy, scalable fashion and <a href="/deploying_rails/" target="_blank">spoke at Railsconf 2014</a> on this topic. I spoke at <a href="/railsconf2015/">Railsconf 2015</a> on how Docker can be tightly integrated with Rails to do far more interesting things than just deployment.

Previously I co-founded <a href="http://www.makeitwithcode.com/" target="_blank">Make It With Code</a>, a project to help none developers to learn to <a href="/2014/01/teaching-people-to-code/" target="_blank">create useful things with code</a>.

Before that I was the back-end lead at Active In Time where among other things we made the <a href="http://www.speedo.com/getspeedofit/getspeedofit_1/getspeedofitapp/gsfapplandingpage.html" target="_blank">Speedo Fit</a> swimming App and explored ways to make fitness more fun using technology (we were the first people to make a swim tracking app for the Apple Watch!).

Other projects include working as the software and embedded device developer behind the <a href="http://www.mousemet.com/" target="_blank">Mousemet Electronic Von Frey</a> and <a href="https://github.com/talkingquickly/dacker">Dacker</a>, an open source Docker orchestration tool written in Ruby.

I travel as much as possible and write about it [here](/travel).

If you only read one thing I've written, [I would suggest
this](/2015/04/what-id-tell-myself-about-startups/).

I'm always interested in chatting to new people whether it's about startups, tech, travel or photography. You can find me on twitter as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/talkingquickly"target="_blank">@talkingquickly</a> or by emailing <a href="mailto:ben@talkingquickly.co.uk">ben@talkingquickly.co.uk</a>.
