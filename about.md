My name's Ben Dixon, I'm a senior developer focused on Ruby on Rails and Android applications. I also have experience of front-end development in both Backbone and Angular JS and infrastructure management with Chef and Docker.

I'm the author of <a href="https://leanpub.com/deploying_rails_applications"
target="_blank">Reliably Deploying Rails Applications</a> which covers how
to deploy medium sized Rails Applications in an easy, scalable fashion and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTofBnxyBUU" target="_blank">spoke at Railsconf 2014</a> on this topic.

I work with the excellent Huw Walters and Rebecca Collins on <a href="http://www.makeitwithcode.com/" target="_blank">Make It With Code</a>, a project to help none developers to learn to <a href="/2014/01/teaching-people-to-code/" target="_blank">create useful things with code</a>.

I live in London but <a href="/travel/">love to travel</a>. I'm currently the back-end lead at Active In Time where among other things we make the <a href="http://www.speedo.com/getspeedofit/getspeedofit_1/getspeedofitapp/gsfapplandingpage.html" target="_blank">Speedo Fit</a> swimming App and explore ways to make fitness more fun using technology.

Other projects include working as the software and embedded device developer behind the <a href="http://www.mousemet.com/" target="_blank">Mousemet Electronic Von Frey</a> and <a href="https://github.com/talkingquickly/dacker">Dacker</a>, an open source Docker orchestration tool written in Ruby.

I'm sometimes available for short pieces of contract development or devops work and always interested in chatting to new people.
