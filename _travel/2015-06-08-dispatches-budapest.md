When you step out of the shower at 9AM, completely blind without
contact lenses and someone shouts "Ben will you take Jane to the
hospital?", you know it's going to be an interesting day.

It seems the previous nights tour of the ruin bars - which are
incredible - had ended with one of our parties feet getting a little
too close to the wheel of a motorbike. At the time a Kiwi and I had
done the only logical thing - run to the shops and purchase three
bars of Milka and a liter of brandy. To be taken immediately.

Somehow our oh so British chocolate and alcohol approach to medicine
didn't quite cut it so the following morning it was time to brave the
Hungarian healthcare system.

A short taxi ride later and we arrived at an imposing, if somewhat
closed hospital. Another not so short taxi ride and we arrived at
something which looked a lot less like a hospital but was at least
open.

I don't think anything has ever made me appreciate the NHS more.
It's the little luxuries you miss - like drinking water, cups and soap.
Asking for drinking water will get you a flat out no, passing out
showed itself to be more effective.

It was an interestingly self service approach to medicine. Payment
was in cash on a "by procedure" basis. Going for an x-ray? Pay the guy
holding the camera and wait while they find your change.

After the x-ray and subsequent consultation we were told,
"fracture, go get a cast" and the door slammed. This was how we came
to be pushing a gurney trolley around a hospital in Budapest asking
strangers "any idea where we could get a cast?". On the upside,
it did feel a little bit like being in a very low budget version
of House.

And yes, we did take selfies on a gurney:

While we waited for the cast to be applied, we were joined by a
somewhat chatty Hungarian convict in handcuffs and accompanied by armed
guards. That was surprising.

For crutches we were directed to a shop on the Buda side which we were
assured was open until 18:00 on Sundays. A ninety minute walk later and
we confirmed that it did not, in fact, open on Sundays.

The people who helped us at the hospital were truly wonderful. On
multiple occasions complete strangers saw we were struggling and came
to offer to translate or point us in the right direction. This attitude
seems to extend throughout Budapest in a way I haven't seen in many
other cities.

It's partly this which makes me understand why so many people say
Budapest is their favorite city. That and the fact it's
beautiful;
