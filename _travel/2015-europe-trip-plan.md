My approach to travel thus far has been quite simple. Arrive, find things thing to do. Repeat. Flawless and well designed as this process may seem, it can - on occassion - lead to missing things or nearly having to sleep on a beach in the rain. This summers trip to Europe will have a little bit more of a plan. As the more astute among you may have realised, this post is that plan.

This trip is loosely organised around European cities which have some sort of a startup scene. I'll be working while I travel so it's essential that every one has well established co-working space. I'll be relying heavily on the amazing [Copass](https://copass.org/) for finding these.

The dates and schedule below will almost certainly fall apart within the first week. But the aim is to have a rough framework rather than a day by day plan.

For anyone hoping for another dose of sarcasm like [when it all went wrong in Thailand](/travel/aonang-a-shambles-even-by-my-standards/), you might find this one a little dry. Normal service will be resumed shortly.

The overall trip looks something like this:

<div style="position: relative;margin: 5px 0 5px 0;padding-bottom: 56.25%;height: 0;clear: both;"><iframe style="position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;width: 100%;height: 100%;border: 0;" src="http://www.tripline.net/map?tripId=34625237445010109FD3FB4EE832962B&onSite=0" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

<br/>

With - I imagine - a sprinkling of random destinations in between.

Dates (subject to constant change) are something like:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Amsterdam, Netherlands
		</td>
		<td>
			21st - 22nd May
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Berlin, Germany
		</td>
		<td>
			22nd - 27th May
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Prague, Czech Republic
		</td>
		<td>
			28th May - 4th June (TBC)
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Budapest, Hungary
		</td>
		<td>
			~ 4th - 10th June
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

# Amsterdam

## Arriving

The trusty Eurolines overnight bus from London comes it at around £30, takes just 11 hours and can't be beaten. There's nothing quite like listening to a stag party singing football chants to lull you to sleep.

## Visiting

[Anne Frank House](http://www.annefrank.org/en/Museum/) - Museum devoted to the 13 year old Jewish girl who was forced into hiding during the second world war to escape the Nazis. Planning to read [The Diary of Anne Frank](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Diary-Young-Girl-Definitive-ebook/dp/B0055N0FZM/) before arriving.

[The Stedelijk Museum](http://www.timeout.com/amsterdam/en/attractions-and-museums/stedelijk-museum) - modern and contemporary art, next to Vondelpark (named after the poet Joost van den Vondel) which is the largest city park in Amsterdam. Sometimes there are free concerts in the open air theatre. Schedule will be announced in [mid April](http://www.openluchttheater.nl/programma).

## Working & Startups

The most central co-working space seems to be [The Thinking Hut](http://www.thethinkinghut.com/) ([copass](https://copass.org/cospaces/the-thinking-hut)) on the South East edge of the Canal District.

There's also [Knowmads Greenhouse](http://www.knowmads.nl/business-partners/greenhouse/) ([copass](https://copass.org/cospaces/knowmads-greenhouse)) which is within the Knowmads business school.

[Sillicon drinkabout Amsterdam](http://3-beards.com/silicondrinkabout/amsterdam) may be happening on the Friday.

## Eating

Raw Herring - I'm told there are food carts selling it everywhere but somehow I've never seen it before. Potentially my mind has carefully prevented me from seeing them. Not this time.

## Sleeping

[St Christophers Inn - The Winston](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/6504/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/2/ppl/1/) is centrally located and the clear winner on Hostel Bookers. Prices range from EUR37 - EUR50 for dorm rooms which is high but Amsterdam was always going to be expensive. Includes Wifi and Breakfast.

[Stayokay Vondelpark](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/3445/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/2/ppl/1/) is a close second and located right next to Vondelpark and the museum district. Comes in at around EUR35 and includes breakfast, Wifi and a walking tour.

[The Flying Pig](http://www.flyingpig.nl/) comes highly recommended by Nomadic [Nomadic Matt](http://www.nomadicmatt.com/) as does [The Bulldog Hotel](http://www.bulldoghotel.com/).

# Berlin

## Arriving

Busses leave Amsterdam at 11:15pm every night, cost around EUR37 and arrive in Berlin at 9:15AM the following morning. Alternatively there are Easyjet flights for around double that.

## Visiting

[Museum Island](http://www.visitberlin.de/en/spot/museum-island) - on the northern tip of Spree Island and home to five major museums. Most interesting seems to be Pergamonmuseum.

The roof of [The Reichstag](http://www.timeout.com/berlin/en/attractions/reichstag) (home of the German parliment) which gives impressive views over Berlin. There's an audio tour which explains the important bits of the skyline. Free to go up but have to [book in advance](http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/visits/kuppel/kupp/245686).

[Walk The Berlin Wall](http://www.timeout.com/berlin/en/attractions-and-museums/walk-the-wall-with-time-out-berlin) Timeout guide covers both the parts which remain, the related artwork and grafiti.

## Working and Startups

[The Agora Collective](http://agoracollective.org/) ([copass](https://copass.org/cospaces/agora-collective)) has excellent reviews on Copass. It's supposed to have a co-working garden, what's not to love? Open 10:00 - 17:00.

## Sleeping

The [St Christophers Inn](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/6579/arr/2015-05-02/ngt/4/ppl/1/) looks promising. Around the EUR23 mark including breakfast.

[ONE80 Hostel](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/79738/arr/2015-05-02/ngt/4/ppl/1/) comes in a close second. Around EUR25 excluding meals.

[Wombats](http://www.wombats-hostels.com/berlin/) also comes highly recommended and is only around EUR20.

# Prague

A city I've been to once on a week long holiday but my primary momentos of it are bar crawl tshirts. I'm told there's some culture there as well.

## Arriving

From Berlin, it takes around 4:30. Either leaving Berlin at 15:00, arriving 19:30 or leaving 19:00, arriving 23:30. There's also 7:30 arriving 12:00. Around EUR20. 

## Visiting

[Charles Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge) clue is in the name, a very impressive bridge.

[The Museum of Communism](http://www.muzeumkomunismu.cz/en/) 9AM - 9PM. Known for presenting a fairly unique insight into what life was like under the Soviet Union.

## Working

[In Spiro](http://in-spiro.cz/) ([copass](https://copass.org/cospaces/in-spiro)) looks promising. I can't read a word of the website but one of the photos includes a pineapple, can't go far wrong with a pineapple.

## Sleeping

The [Hostel Downtown](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/20239/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/3/ppl/1/) has a common room with a Piano. So I feel there's no need to look any further. Around EUR25/ Night.

Piano aside, the [Old Prague Hostel](http://www.hostelbookers.com/propertyreviews/prp/5256/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/3/ppl/1/) apparently provides unlimited sandwiches and is only EUR17/ night. A tough choice to be made nearer the time.

# Budapest

## Arriving

Leaving 07:00 arriving Budapest at 14:30. Or 15:00 -> 22:30. About GBP10.

## Visiting

[The Royal Palace & Castle Hill](http://visitbudapest.travel/guide/budapest-attractions/royal-palace/) apparently a walking tour is the way to go.

[Széchenyi Bath](http://welovebudapest.com/shops.and.services.1/sports.and.wellness.2/szechenyi.bath) is a huge spa complex underpinned by the thermal springs below Budapest.

[Heroes Square](http://welovebudapest.com/budapest.and.hungary/sights.1/heroes.square) because big squares are cool OK.

A boat trip along the Dabube at night, apparently one of the best ways to see and photograph some of the amazing panoramas the city has to offer.

Climb [Gellert Hill](http://welovebudapest.com/budapest.and.hungary/sights.1/gellert.hill). Because walking and great views are fun.

## Working

[Loffice Coworking](http://www.budapest.lofficecoworking.com/index.php?language=en) ([copass](https://copass.org/cospaces/loffice-coworking)) looks promising. 

[Kaptar](http://kaptarbudapest.hu/en) ([copass](https://copass.org/cospaces/kaptar-coworking-office)) also looks interesting. Their focus seems to be heavily on real life communities and people. 

## Sleeping

[Home Plus Hostel](http://www.hostelbookers.com/propertyreviews/prp/29071/arr/2015-05-09/ngt/6/ppl/1/) offers free dinners three times a week. Which is hard to beat.

[Astoria City Hostel](http://www.hostelbookers.com/propertyreviews/prp/4308/arr/2015-05-09/ngt/6/ppl/1/) has impressive reviews and most importantly a kitchen. By this point there's a good chance I'll be missing cooking for myself.

[Aboriginal](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g274887-d577388-Reviews-Aboriginal_Hostel-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html) is meant to have an amazing atmosphere. 

# Sofia

## Arriving

Eurolines from Budapest to Sofia, 12 hours leaving at 6pm, arriving 6am on the 14th. About GBP30. 

## Visiting

The [Free Sofia Walking Tour](http://freesofiatour.com/) one of the only cities I've come across which has free walking tours run by a well regarded none profit.

The [Museum of Socialist Art](http://nationalartgallerybg.org/index.php?l=4) contains primarily art from 1944 to 1989 but I'm most interested in the black and white propoganda shorts.

## Working

[Betahouse](http://www.betahaus.bg/en/) ([copass](https://copass.org/cospaces/betahaus-sofia)) looks promising. One of a larger network with spaces in Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne.

## Sleeping

[Hostel Mostel](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/4402/arr/2015-05-14/ngt/3/ppl/1/) has exceptionally good reviews and looks to be very reasonably priced, around EUR6 - EUR11 per night. It's also recommended as one of Nomadic Matts favourite hostels, apparently booking well in advance is recommended.

# Bucharest

[This website](http://www.virtualromania.org/places/bucharest.vr/places.vr/) has been useful for deciding what to do.

## Arriving

Probably via train as there doesn't seem to be a Eurolines service between Sofia and Bucharest. Train appears to take a bit under 10 hours and cost around GBP10.

## Visiting

The [Palace of Parliament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Parliament) is the largest government building in the world and the second largest building in the world after the Pentagon. As anyone who ever watched the masterpiece that was "big, bigger, biggest" knows, big stuff is cool.

The [Romanian Atheneum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Athenaeum) is a concert hall in the center of Bucharest, performances are on the 21st and 22nd, tickets are available [here](http://fge.org.ro/ro/component/jevents/day.listevents/2015/05/21/-.html)

[The Village Museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitrie_Gusti_National_Village_Museum) is an open air museum containing several hundred wooden houses, windmills, churches and the like. Apparently many of the buildings are genuine and were taken to the museum in pieces and re-assembled.

[Cișmigiu Gardens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ci%C8%99migiu_Gardens) - a park in the center of Bucharest. All parks must be visited.

## Sleeping

[Antique Hostel](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/85694/arr/2015-05-18/ngt/2/ppl/1/) looks promising and comes in at a bargain EUR10/ night including breakfast. Looks like the right choice if aiming for relaxation.

[X Hostel](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/74966/arr/2015-05-18/ngt/2/ppl/1/) may however win because it has "Escape Room" games for free. Several friends have tried this in London, you have an hour to escape from a room through a combination of gadgets, riddles and puzzles. Sounds like more of a party hostel.

# Warsaw

[This site](http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/top-10-3930.html) is useful for choosing things to do.

## Arriving



## Seeing

[Łazienki Królewskie Museum](http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/azienki-kr-lewskie-museum-muzeum-azienki-kr-lewskie-3347.html)

## Sleeping

# Talin

## Sleeping

[Tallin Backpackers](http://www.tallinnbackpackers.com/) ([hostel bookers](http://www.hostelbookers.com/hostels/estonia/tallinn/31456/)) is recommended by Nomadic Matt. [Euphoria](http://euphoria.traveller.ee/) also looks promising for a more relaxed stay.
