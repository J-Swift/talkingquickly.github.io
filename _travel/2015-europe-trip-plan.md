My approach to travel thus far has been quite simple. Arrive, find things thing to do. Repeat. Flawless and well designed as this process may seem, it can - on occassion - lead to missing things or nearly having to sleep on a beach in the rain. This summers trip to Europe will have a little bit more of a plan. As the more astute among you may have realised, this post is that plan.

This trip is loosely organised around European cities which have some sort of a startup scene. I'll be working while I travel so it's essential that every one has well established co-working space. I'll be relying heavily on the amazing [Copass](https://copass.org/) for finding these.

The dates and schedule below will almost certainly fall apart within the first week. But the aim is to have a rough framework rather than a day by day plan.

# Amsterdam

## Arriving

28th of April from London, staying for around three days.

The trusty Eurolines overnight bus from London comes it at around £30, takes just 11 hours and can't be beaten. There's nothing quite like listening to a stag party singing football chants to lull you to sleep.

## Visiting

[Anne Frank House](http://www.annefrank.org/en/Museum/) - Museum devoted to the 13 year old Jewish girl who was forced into hiding during the second world war to escape the Nazis. Planning to read [The Diary of Anne Frank](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Diary-Young-Girl-Definitive-ebook/dp/B0055N0FZM/) before arriving.

[The Stedelijk Museum](http://www.timeout.com/amsterdam/en/attractions-and-museums/stedelijk-museum) - modern and contemporary art, next to Vondelpark (named after the poet Joost van den Vondel) which is the largest city park in Amsterdam. Sometimes there are free concerts in the open air theatre. Schedule will be announced in [mid April](http://www.openluchttheater.nl/programma).

## Working & Startups

The most central co-working space seems to be [The Thinking Hut](http://www.thethinkinghut.com/) ([copass](https://copass.org/cospaces/the-thinking-hut)) on the South East edge of the Canal District.

There's also [Knowmads Greenhouse](http://www.knowmads.nl/business-partners/greenhouse/) ([copass](https://copass.org/cospaces/knowmads-greenhouse)) which is within the Knowmads business school.

[Sillicon drinkabout Amsterdam](http://3-beards.com/silicondrinkabout/amsterdam) may be happening on the Friday.

## Eating

Raw Herring - I'm told there are food carts selling it everywhere but somehow I've never seen it before. Potentially my mind has carefully blocked prevented me from seeing them. Not this time.

## Sleeping

[St Christophers Inn - The Winston](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/6504/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/2/ppl/1/) is centrally located and the clear winner on Hostel Bookers. Prices range from EUR37 - EUR50 for dorm rooms which is high but Amsterdam was always going to be expensive. Includes Wifi and Breakfast.

[Stayokay Vondelpark](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/3445/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/2/ppl/1/) is a close second and located right next to Vondelpark and the museum district. Comes in at around EUR35 and includes breakfast, Wifi and a walking tour.

# Berlin

## Arriving

Eurolines from Amsterdam around 1st/ 2nd of May. Busses leave Amsterdam at 11:15pm every night, cost around EUR37 and arrive in Berlin at 9:15AM the following morning. Alternatively there are Easyjet flights for around double that.

## Visiting

[Museum Island](http://www.visitberlin.de/en/spot/museum-island) - on the northern tip of Spree Island and home to five major museums. Most interesting seems to be Pergamonmuseum.

The roof of [The Reichstag](http://www.timeout.com/berlin/en/attractions/reichstag) (home of the German parliment) which gives impressive views over Berlin. Can get an audio tour which explains the important bits of the skyline. Free to go up but have to [book in advance](http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/visits/kuppel/kupp/245686).

[Walk The Berlin Wall](http://www.timeout.com/berlin/en/attractions-and-museums/walk-the-wall-with-time-out-berlin) Timeout guide covers both the parts which remain, the related artwork and the grafiti.

## Working and Startups

[The Agora Collective](http://agoracollective.org/) ([copass](https://copass.org/cospaces/agora-collective)) has excellent reviews on Copass. It's supposed to have a co-working garden, what's not to love? Open 10:00 - 17:00.

## Sleeping

The [St Christophers Inn](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/6579/arr/2015-05-02/ngt/4/ppl/1/) looks promising. Around the EUR23 mark including breakfast.

[ONE80 Hostel](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/79738/arr/2015-05-02/ngt/4/ppl/1/) comes in a close second. Around EUR25 excluding meals.

# Prague

A city I've been to once on a week long holiday but my primary momentos of it are bar crawl tshirts. I'm told there's some culture there as well.

## Arriving

Eurolines, Wednesday 6th from Berlin, takes 4:30. Either leaving Berlin at 15:00, arriving 19:30 or leaving 19:00, arriving 23:30. There's also 7:30 arriving 12:00. Around EUR20. 

## Visiting

[Charles Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge) clue is in the name, a very impressive bridge.

[The Museum of Communism](http://www.muzeumkomunismu.cz/en/) 9AM - 9PM. Known for presenting a fairly unique insight into what life was like under the Soviet Union.

## Working

[In Spiro](http://in-spiro.cz/) ([copass](https://copass.org/cospaces/in-spiro)) looks promising. I can't read a word of the website but one of the photos includes a pineapple, can't go far wrong with a pineapple.

## Sleeping

The [Hostel Downtown](http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/20239/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/3/ppl/1/) has a common room with a Piano. So I feel there's no need to look any further. Around EUR25/ Night.

Piano aside, the [Old Prague Hostel](http://www.hostelbookers.com/propertyreviews/prp/5256/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/3/ppl/1/) apparently provides unlimited sandwiches and is only EUR17/ night. A tough choice to be made nearer the time.

# Budapest

## Arriving

Eurolines, Saturday 9th. Leaving 07:00 arriving Budapest at 14:30. Or 15:00 -> 22:30. About GBP10.

## Visiting

[The Royal Palace & Castle Hill](http://visitbudapest.travel/guide/budapest-attractions/royal-palace/) apparently a walking tour is the way to go.

[Széchenyi Bath](http://welovebudapest.com/shops.and.services.1/sports.and.wellness.2/szechenyi.bath) is a huge spa complex underpinned by the thermal springs below Budapest.

[Heroes Square](http://welovebudapest.com/budapest.and.hungary/sights.1/heroes.square) because big squares are cool OK.

A boat trip along the Dabube at night, apparently one of the best ways to see and photograph some of the amazing panoramas the city has to offer.

Climb [Gellert Hill](http://welovebudapest.com/budapest.and.hungary/sights.1/gellert.hill) because walking is fun and great views are fun.

## Working

[Loffice Coworking](http://www.budapest.lofficecoworking.com/index.php?language=en) ([copass](https://copass.org/cospaces/loffice-coworking)) looks promising. 

[Kaptar](http://kaptarbudapest.hu/en) ([copass](https://copass.org/cospaces/kaptar-coworking-office)) also looks interesting. Their focus seems to be heavily on real life communities and people.
