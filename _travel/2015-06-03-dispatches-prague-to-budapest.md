The Czech's truly have turned drinking into an art form, or more specifically, into a sport.

Introducing "The Pub". It's a lot like a regular Pub in many respects, there is beer, food and people drink said beer.

It departs from normalcy shortly afterwards. Each table is equipped with four "pour your own" beer pumps. Before pouring, you select the name of the drinker to ensure the volume poured is attributed correctly.

This naturally requires a leader board to track total
consumption. But the Czech's, who I'm growing to truly love, have taken it one step further.

Projected onto the wall is not just a table by table leader board, but a city by city one.

Two important lessons were learned whilst indulging in this so called
sport:

It's actually very difficult to pull a pint which isn't entirely
foam

1. Two Londoners are highly unlikely to secure a place on a leader
board when competing against groups of 6+ Czechs
1. My favorite part of Prague is still by far the Old Town Square.
Touristy but beautiful. It's by far the most expensive place to grab a
beer but the sunsets make it worthwhile:

And if that's not enough, there's an extremely talented Polish man who
waits until shortly after sunset to play with fire:

Having reluctantly bidden farewell to Prague, I'm writing this on what I
can only describe as a hybrid between a train and and a sauna. We could
be in Bratslava but it's tough to be sure.

The "travel everywhere by bus" plan is largely falling by the wayside.
Trains seem to cost barely more and depart far more frequently.
Although I'll reserve judgment until this one arrives somewhere
recognisable.

_Continued 04/06_

Trains are winning, now safely in Budapest. The day began with a run
along the Danube followed by finding one of the friendliest co-working
spaces I've ever encountered.
