        <section class="post-content">
            <p>This is, in no particular order, what I&#39;d tell myself about startups if I could go back in time to when I first got involved. Which is probably the same as what I&#39;ve learned. This is most definitely not advice, the &quot;you&quot; here is directed at me. So is &quot;I&quot;. Grammar is hard.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You&#39;re definitely going to end up building too much and shipping too late. Be obsessive about avoiding this</p></li>
<li><p>Someone&#39;s always already working on the same idea and that&#39;s not a bad thing</p></li>
<li><p>Always refuse if someone asks you to sign an NDA before hearing their idea</p></li>
<li><p>Like it or not, most networking in London is focused around drinking. Find a way to deal with that without having a constant hangover</p></li>
<li><p>The people who are really getting somewhere aren&#39;t the people who are always out for drinks</p></li>
<li><p>Linear growth can be worse than no growth</p></li>
<li><p>Most people who talk about failing fast, aren&#39;t actually practicing this</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s really easy to kid yourself that you&#39;re &quot;doing customer development&quot; when actually you&#39;re finding ways to make what your customers are saying fit with what you want to build</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone has a hidden stash of domains they&#39;ve never used</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s really easy to become hyper-critical and respond to every idea with &quot;yeah but that won&#39;t work because of x&quot;. This is lazy, don&#39;t do it.</p></li>
<li><p>Be especially careful to avoid the above when talking to people who are new to the scene. Call out other people who do it</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s really hard to listen to someone pitching an idea you&#39;ve seen fail several times already and focus on working out if there&#39;s something slightly different and interesting there</p></li>
<li><p>Someone being a technically competent developer does not mean they know how to ship things. I&#39;d always rather work with someone who ships over someone who&#39;s technically brilliant</p></li>
<li><p>The programming language/ framework wars are great fun in the pub, but of limited value in real life</p></li>
<li><p>A good developer can pick up any language or platform in a few weeks</p></li>
<li><p>I still don&#39;t know any real investors</p></li>
<li><p>Constantly exaggerating how well you&#39;re doing can be very tiring. It makes it harder to publicly celebrate the real victories</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s really hard to build a product if you don&#39;t have a big personal investment in the problem it solves</p></li>
<li><p>Falling in love with a product (rather than the problem) is really dangerous</p></li>
<li><p>You can get away without knowing how a hash table works, but it&#39;s really satisfying when you eventually learn it</p></li>
<li><p>Same goes for Big O notation</p></li>
<li><p>Overnight success isn&#39;t a thing. The Social Network is still a great movie</p></li>
<li><p>I still don&#39;t understand PR</p></li>
<li><p>Most technical solutions are trivial compared to how you get the product into peoples hands</p></li>
<li><p>Make something people want is probably a less useful heuristic than make something you want</p></li>
<li><p>But you wanting it doesn&#39;t mean enough people want it for it to be a business</p></li>
<li><p>If you don&#39;t have first hand experience of an industry, you&#39;re probably wrong about how it works, what problems they have and so how they should be solved. Talk to people</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Ads&quot; are where business models go to die</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;We&#39;ll monetize the data&quot; is the new &quot;Ads&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>The people you end up wanting to work with (and help) are the ones who always try and work out how they can help you. Be more like them</p></li>
<li><p>But get really good at asking for things. Most people will give you a discount for no reason other than you asked. If you see someone important and influential, introduce yourself</p></li>
<li><p>Get good at saying no to things, from people asking you for discounts to interesting projects you really don&#39;t have enough time for</p></li>
<li><p>Think hard about a pivot which makes good business sense but leads to a product you no longer care about</p></li>
<li><p>Writing (blogging, books, journaling) is a really positive experience</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t pay too much attention to internet comments about something you&#39;ve written, there&#39;s always someone who didn&#39;t like one particular sentence (see point about trolls below)</p></li>
<li><p>One troll can wipe out a hundred positive interactions, be ruthless in keeping them out of your communities</p></li>
<li><p>If you end up pitching to someone over coffee, ask to hear their pitch afterwards</p></li>
<li><p>Only say you&#39;re going to introduce someone or send them something if you&#39;re actually going to do it. People quickly get a reputation for never following through</p></li>
<li><p>Show don&#39;t tell. &quot;I&#39;m going to build this amazing thing&quot; is a LOT less interesting than &quot;I&#39;ve built this slightly crappy thing that actually does something&quot;. EVERYONE is GOING to build something, most people never do</p></li>
<li><p>Building things is awesome, don&#39;t get too caught up with the whole &quot;Lean Startup Landing Page&quot; mindset</p></li>
<li><p>Lean Startup is awesome, but it&#39;s a pamphlet not a book, read the first few chapters and you&#39;ll get the idea. Four steps to the epiphany is more technical and probably a better book</p></li>
<li><p>Most startup advice is terrible and the good advice is usually obvious. Everyone will give different advice, trust your gut</p></li>
<li><p>Except when it comes to what your customers want, then ignore your gut and trust them</p></li>
<li><p>No-one has ever used a Bitcoin ATM for practical reasons</p></li>
<li><p>Do back of napkin financial forecasts for every potential business model you come up with, just to see if it&#39;s in the right ballpark to a couple of orders of magnitude</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s really easy to automatically dismiss everyone who starts a conversation with &quot;I&#39;m looking for a technical co-founder&quot;. Doing this means you miss talking to some interesting people. But be upfront that you&#39;re not that co-founder so no-one feels like their time is wasted</p></li>
<li><p>Trying to raise money and apply to accelerators is a full time job. You&#39;re probably either building or fund raising. Not both. If in doubt, choose building</p></li>
<li><p>The solution to many, many problems, is not technical. That won&#39;t stop people trying solve them with apps</p></li>
<li><p>Facebook is the Facebook for X</p></li>
<li><p>The idea you laughed at when you saw them pitch at a hackathon may well be the one that&#39;s still alive and kicking long after whatever you pitched fails</p></li>
<li><p>If there are people who genuinely like failing, I&#39;ve never met them</p></li>
<li><p>That was not &quot;your idea&quot; unless you shipped something, otherwise I invented Facebook, Nest and Oculus Rift</p></li>
<li><p>People don&#39;t steal ideas. Tell as many people as possible. Never ask someone to sign an NDA before hearing your idea, you&#39;ll instantly lose all credibility</p></li>
<li><p>Being friends with somebody is not the same as being able to work well with them</p></li>
<li><p>Small teams can move VERY fast, be really careful getting extra people involved in any project where agility is important</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-tasking isn&#39;t a thing, switching costs are huge, do one thing at a time and do it really well. Find a way to block out interruptions</p></li>
<li><p>Read every <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">essay</a> Paul Graham has written</p></li>
<li><p>Tech news (and news in general) has a very low return on time invested. Prefer books and conversations</p></li>
<li><p>Read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Problem-Solution/dp/1430210788">Founders Stories</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Chance-Markets-ebook/dp/B002RI9BH6/">Fooled By Randomness</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank-ebook/dp/B00FLZKNUQ/">The Four Steps to the Ephiphany</a></p></li>
<li><p>The logo doesn&#39;t matter at the start, find a simple text based logo you can re-use for different projects</p></li>
<li><p>If you possibly can, open source and write up any side project. Every now and then you&#39;ll meet somebody really interesting as a result</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly working 12 hour days is probably never a good idea. If this is happening a lot, find a way to optimise</p></li>
<li><p>Talk to everybody</p></li>
