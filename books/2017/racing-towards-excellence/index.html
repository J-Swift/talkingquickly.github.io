        <section class="post-content">
            <ul>
<li>Difference between objectives and vision. Objectives are generally short term goals, vision is something long term which creates sustained happiness. </li>
<li>Difference between motivation and inspiration. Motivation can have many sources (e.g. hunger, fear, short term desires), Inspiration is long term and can only really be &quot;conscious&quot;. Inspiration can only really be positive and then best way to gauge if we are truly inspired is enthusiasm, are we enthused and mildly, but consistently, excited about he goal we are inspired towards.</li>
<li>The importance of looking at oneself with love. Of looking at our own mistakes with the same compassion we look at others when they make the same mistakes</li>
<li>The  importance of balance, the books core visualisation is the concept of the four accounts:

<ul>
<li>Physical</li>
<li>Material</li>
<li>Emotional</li>
<li>Mental</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Our activities should aim to maximise these but never maximise one at the (long term) expense of another</li>
<li>The different between efficiency (ongoing incremental changes, often learned by looking at others) and leverage (step changes, often against conventional wisdom) as a way to improve output and the importance of mastering both</li>
<li>Reading is like cheating (in a good way!)</li>
<li>Responsibility is not something imposed on us, it is our power to take control of and change things. Reframing responsibility in this manner can help create enthusiasm for behaving &quot;responsibly&quot;</li>
<li>There is a big difference between &quot;enjoying&quot; something because it&#39;s in our comfort zone (e.g. watching television) and enjoy something because it&#39;s genuinely fulfilling for us (e.g. mastering a skill, reading something stimulating)</li>
<li>Be honest and open when communicating, this includes at work(!). Maintain consistency of communication across different parts of your life</li>
<li>Networking is not people standing in rooms exchanging business cards, it&#39;s exposing yourself to people you might otherwise not meet. It&#39;s a great example of trying to expose yourself to as much randomness as you possibly can. <em>Love</em> this way of explaining it</li>
<li>See pages 229-230 for an excellent hypothetical questions section. Great for making you address hard questions about what you&#39;re doing and why. E.g. along the lines of:

<ul>
<li>What would you do if you never had to work again?</li>
<li>What would you do differently if there was a public record of everything you said?</li>
<li>Imagine you could have a huge amount of money for life on the condition of not being unhappy for a single day, what would you do?</li>
<li>Where would you like to live? Where do you live? If they&#39;re different, why?</li>
<li>What would you do if you were told you only had six months to live? Why not do that now </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
