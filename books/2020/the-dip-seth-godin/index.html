        <h1 class="post-title">The Dip - Seth Godin</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Overall:</p>

<ul>
<li>Quit the wrong stuff</li>
<li>Stick with the right stuff</li>
<li>Have the guts to do one or the other </li>
</ul>

<p>Quitting is often a good thing, except in a subset of situations where it&#39;s exactly the wrong thing to do.</p>

<p>Being the best is important, first place will often make 10x the rewards of 2nd place.</p>

<p>With limited time or opportunity to experiment, we intentionally narrow our choices to those at the top</p>

<p>Scarcity makes being at the top valuable, most people won&#39;t get there because they&#39;ll quit along the way to becoming the best.</p>

<p>Niche is important here, being the best in the world at the specific thing, e.g. there are more categories now that there&#39;s a bigger pool and greater discoverability</p>

<p>In general the number of options at any given point is approaching infinity </p>

<p>Big companies tend to fail in new markets because they are willing to compromise, e.g. because they believe they are big and powerful, they can settle for being OK rather than truly remarkable.</p>

<p>Most wrong thing people learn in school is that being well rounded is the secret to success</p>

<p>The people who skip the hard questions and do all the ones they can do are the majority, and they are not in demand. In general it&#39;s not rounded people who are  in demand it&#39;s people who are exceptionally good at something in particular who are in demand</p>

<p>&quot;Strategic quitting is the secret of successful organisations. Reactive quitting and serial quitting are the bane of those that strive (and fail) to get what they want. And most people do just that. They quite when it&#39;s painful and stick when they can&#39;t be bothered to quit/&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The dip is the long slog between starting and mastery&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s easy to be the CEO, what&#39;s hard is getting there&quot; (they had a 25 year dip of hard slow, head down, do as your told long hours)</p>

<p>Living through the dip doesn&#39;t mean quietly enduring, try and change rules, whittle it down etc, but it will still exist.</p>

<p>Alternative to the dip is the cul de sac, e.g. doesn&#39;t go anywhere. Opportunity cost here is high, so need to quit.</p>

<p>Pretty much anything that&#39;s worth doing has a dip.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the cliff, e.g. things that get better and better overtime until they become awful. E.g. smoking gets more enjoyable over time until it kills you.</p>

<p>An example of a good thing to do is quitting a wider market to double down on being the best in a small market.</p>

<p>An example of a really stupid thing to do is to start snowboarding, then quit a few days in (the first few days of snowboarding really suck). So both not starting and powering through the dip are smart, doing it until you get fed up then quitting is dumb.</p>

<p>In a competitive world, adversity is your friend, the harder it gets, the better chance you have of insulating yourself from the competition.</p>

<p>Jack Welch at GE, if we can&#39;t be #1 or #2 in an industry, we must get out.</p>

<p>Everything where we can&#39;t be #1 or #2 saps focus from other things.</p>

<p>Parallel with windsurfing, it&#39;s easy except for the wind which changes all the time and makes it hard. All disciplines have their wind equivilant, if this wasn&#39;t there, it wouldn&#39;t be profitable, because it would be easy.</p>

<p>So the dip is the primary opportunity.</p>

<p>When faced with the dip, a common and bad response is to diversify. Real success instead goes to those who obsess.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easier to be mediocre than it is to confront reality and quit.</p>

<p>Weightlifting is an interesting example, all of the benefit is the last few seconds after you&#39;ve tired out your muscles. Most people do the tiring out, then quit just before the bit with the benefit</p>

<p>Quitting in the dip is, in-general a bad idea, if the journey was worth taking then it&#39;s worth getting through the dip. If you quit in the dip too often, you&#39;ll find yourself a serial quitter, starting lots of stuff, but never achieving much. Embracing that rule will make you a lot more selective about the journeys you choose.</p>

<p>A really deep dip is what provides the opportunity to be successful. </p>

<p>Not only do you need to find the opportunity with the dip, but also need to quit all the cul-de-sacs that don&#39;t offer the same possible return. This is hard.</p>

<p>Seven reasons you&#39;ll fail to be the best in the world:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run out of time and quit</li>
<li>Run out of money and quit</li>
<li>You get scared and quit</li>
<li>You&#39;re not serious about it and quit</li>
<li>You lose interest or enthusiasm or settle for being mediocre and quit</li>
<li>You focus on the short term instead of the long and quit when the short term gets hard</li>
<li>You pick the wrong thing at which to be the best in the world (because you don&#39;t have the talent)</li>
</ol>

<p>Pyramids underpin the dip. E.g. people who use healthclubs are subsidised by all the people who sign up but never go. Quitting creates scarcity and scarcity creates value (me: is language learning an example of this?? Most people quit early on). </p>

<p>Examples of systems with dips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Manufacturing: easy to design something in garage, incredibly hard to transition to manufacturing that thing</li>
<li>Sales: generally easy to sell a few of something yourself, incredibly hard to scale to a professional sales organisation</li>
<li>Education: learning new skills or re-inventing skill set tends to be a dip before the rewards (think medicine)</li>
<li>Risk: E.g. at some point you can&#39;t pay to build it yourself, so need money to fund through the dip</li>
<li>Relationships: E.g. people who only care about relationships that offer them something now don&#39;t maintain and invest in relationships that will offer them something in the future</li>
<li>Conceptual Dip: E.g. abandoning a mental model in favour of one that will get you to the next level</li>
<li>Ego Dip: E.g. giving up control and handing things over to the organisation</li>
<li>Distribution dip: E.g. getting distribution from large retailers often requires a big upfront investment</li>
</ul>

<p>Planning for these dips in advance, and deciding whether or not you have the staying power to get through them is important and reduces the odds of failure.</p>

<p>The space shuttle was a cul de sac cancelling would (did) force us to come up with something better, safer, cheaper. But for a long time nobody had the guts to cancel it.</p>

<p>The goal of competitor is to create a dip so huge that the competition can&#39;t catch up.</p>

<p>&quot;If you can get through the Dip, if you can keep going when the system is expecting you to drop, you will achieve extraordinary results. People who make it through the Dip are scarce indeed, so they generate more value&quot;. </p>

<p>Ideally if you&#39;re going to quit, quit before you start.</p>

<p>&quot;The most common response to the dip is to play it safe, to do ordinary work, blameless work, work that&#39;s beyond reproach. When faced with the Dip, most people suck it up and try to average their way to success.</p>

<p>To be a superstar, you must do something exceptional. Not just survive the dup, but use the dip as an opportunity to create something so extraordinary that people can&#39;t help but talk about it, recommend it, and yes, choose it.</p>

<p>The next time you catch yourself being average when you feel like quitting, realize that you have only two good choices; quit or be exceptional. Average is for losers.&quot;</p>

<p>Startups can be like queues, e.g. people who switch queues whenever they see a line that looks like it might be a bit shorter or moving a bit faster, that&#39;s the entrepreneur that&#39;s on their sixth or twelfth project, whenever it gets really tough, they switch. In the same way that&#39;s the slowest way to get out of supermarket, that&#39;s not a good path to a successful business.</p>

<p>Starting up is great fun and exciting, but lots of people are good at starting and then don&#39;t want to pay their hard slog dues and so only ever do the starting part.</p>

<p>Salespeople often suffer from the same problem, e.g. they quit after five attempts and people buy at seven. </p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t want to buy a new product until it&#39;s tried, tested and proven. So up until that point, it&#39;s a painful, hard, slog.</p>

<p>&quot;You must quit products, features and designs regularly if you&#39;re going to grow and have the resources to invest in the right business, but you mustn&#39;t quit a market, strategy or niche...decide once and for all whether you&#39;re in a market or not and then if you are, get through the niche.&quot;</p>

<p>The market overall wants to see you persist, e.g. the market is primarily made up of not early adopters.</p>

<p>&quot;The opposite of quitting isn&#39;t waiting around&quot; - it is strategies that actively try and break the problem apart. Aggressive action can make the dip both better and worse.</p>

<p>&quot;Quitting in the dip is usually a short term decision and a bad one&quot;</p>

<p>Think of where people quit marathons, it&#39;s not mile 25, it&#39;s probably something like mile 20, when the finish seems just too far away but you&#39;ve been going for long enough that you&#39;re exhausted</p>

<p>&quot;Is the pain of the dip worth the light at the end of the tunnel&quot;. E.g. it won&#39;t be for getting better at working in print media, because in the end, print media is dying.</p>

<p>Time to look for a new job is when you don&#39;t need one, e.g. before you&#39;ve plateaued.</p>

<p>&quot;Never quit&quot; is dreadful advice &quot;Never quit something with great long term potential because you can&#39;t deal with the stress of the moment&quot;</p>

<p>Questions to ask before quitting:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I panicking?</li>
<li>Who am I trying to influence?</li>
<li>What sort of measurable progress am I making?</li>
</ol>

<p>Generally a good idea to set your criteria for quitting before you get to the dip, so that you&#39;re not making the decision off the back of. </p>

<p>Think carefully about size of market entering, e.g. do you have the resources to make an impact on this market. Bicycle tyre analogy, e.g. first few pumps make very little different to how inflated it seems. Figure how much pressure you have and then pick the tyre.</p>

<h2>Questions from the end</h2>

<ol>
<li>Is this a dip, a cliff or a cul-de-sac</li>
<li>If it&#39;s a cul-de-sac, how can I change it into a dip</li>
<li>If my persistence going to pay off in the long run</li>
<li>Am I engaged with just one person or organisation or do my actions in this situation spill over into the entire marketplace</li>
<li>When should I quit? I need to decide now, not when I&#39;m in the middle of it, and not when part of me is begging to quit</li>
<li>If I quit this task, will it increase my ability to fet through the dip on something more important?</li>
<li>If I&#39;m going to quit anyway, is there something dramatic I can do instead that might change the game?</li>
<li>Should I really be calling on IBM, should I really be trying to get on Oprah?</li>
<li>What chance does this project have to be the best in the world? </li>
<li>Who decides what best is?</li>
<li>Can we make the world smaller?</li>
<li>Does it make sense to submit a resume to every single ad on Craigslist, just to see what happens?</li>
<li>If I like my job, is it time to quit?</li>
<li>Is doing nothing better than planning on quirring and then doing something great? </li>
<li>Are you avoiding the remarkable as a way of quitting without quitting?</li>
</ol>

<p>If it scares you, it might be a good thing to try.</p>
