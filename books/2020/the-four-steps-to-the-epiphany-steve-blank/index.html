        <section class="post-content">
            <h2>Misc</h2>

<ul>
<li>Eric Reis (Lean Startup) was student in class taught by Steve Blank</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<ul>
<li>Winners succeed by customer development based approach to product, e.g. not the traditional product launch mode.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Â Introduction</h2>

<ul>
<li>There was a lack of a process to search for a business model. This is customer development.</li>
<li>Business model canvas came much later, useful single interface for bringing hypothesis together in one place</li>
</ul>

<p>[Insert Graphic of lean canvas here]</p>

<h2>Chapter 1 - The Path to Disaster</h2>

<ul>
<li>Webvan as the classic example of how not to do it. Raise loads of money, build out nice website (in this case website = product) and comprehensive product, launch. Failed to ask &quot;where are the customers&quot;. This is backwards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Product Development model (the wrong way)</h3>

<p>This chapter may feel less relevant because this is no longer the accepted approach. But it&#39;s elements of this that it&#39;s SO easy to fall back into.</p>

<ul>
<li>Comes from manufacturing. Works fine when launching product into well understood industry with clear customers, competition etc.<br></li>
<li>Stage 1: Concept and seed. 1) Capture vision and create business plan, vision from this. 2) Define product and service concept, 3) work out what&#39;s needed to build it, what the features are etc. 4) Get customer feedback 5) work out who competitors are, positioning etc 6) work out financing requirements based on this</li>
<li>Stage 2: Product development. Break into departments, e.g. engineering (waterfall) starts building, marketing refines size of market etc. </li>
<li>Stage 3: Alpha / Beta test, work with small group of customers to test product. Marketing, sales etc, kick off initial activities, scale up sales function </li>
<li>... further stages along the same line, not documenting here.</li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn&#39;t work well for startups because;</p>

<ol>
<li>Where are the customers? Ignores that the greatest risk and so greatest reason for failure is not being able to find customers. IT IS NOT BEING ABLE TO BUILD PRODUCT.</li>
<li>Focussing on first customer ship date. This just means some element of product is ready, not that we understand customers etc. Ignores customer discovery. Ends up being that sales most now go and find customers, no idea if these people even exist or if early beta customer acquisition can scale at all</li>
<li>Emphasis on execution instead of learning and discovery. This leads to sales thinking they&#39;re being hired for what they know, not what they can learn. So they&#39;ll tend to try and apply they&#39;re prior experience rather than learning themselves. Most entrepreneurs will feel like they most of the answers to the customer questions, if this is true, the process will be quick (but it probably isn&#39;t true). Inherently linear process. In practice it should be lots of iterative circles, e.g. lots of customer conversations, some of which take us down dead ends</li>
<li>The lack of meaningful sales, bd milestones etc. Engineering goals are clear, e.g. requirements docs etc, but this is not clear in a product development model for sales etc. E.g. what&#39;s needed from them will tend to be nebulous, so instead will focus on execution, e.g. creating collateral, generating leads etc. In reality the goal should be a deep understanding of customers, their pains and how they buy. How well do we understand problems, how much will they pay to solve them, where do we sit in their hierarchy of problems, have we found &quot;visionary customers&quot; who will buy early? &quot;Rush to execution&quot; leads to skipping customer understanding completely.</li>
<li>The use of product development methodology for sales. A process which works well for &quot;we need to build x&quot; doesn&#39;t work well for &quot;we need to understand x&quot;. <strong>E.g. natural output here will be &quot;the day the product is done, sell at volume&quot;, this makes no sense.</strong></li>
<li>The use of product development methodology for marketing. First customer ship == feeding lead pipeline. Marketing will therefore start creating collateral which inherently includes positioning. So all of this gets done before sales has found out what works.</li>
<li>Premature scaling. Leads to building out large expensive Sales and Market organisations long before actually understanding customers (and until this is true, there&#39;s very little those orgs can do)</li>
<li>Death spiral. Caused by premature scaling, burn accelerates, revenue lags behind, pressure for revenue increases, marketing spend goes up to try and correct for lack of revenue, runway decreases rapidly. Die.</li>
<li>Not all startups are alike. 4 categories: 1. Bringing new product existing market, 2. Bringing new product into new market, 3. Bringing new product into existing market and trying to resect that market as low cost entrant, 4. Bringing new product into existing market and trying to resect that market as a niche entrant. Existing product development method <em>sometimes</em> works for bringing a new product into a well understood existing market. Most startups aren&#39;t going after well understood existing markets, so product development approach won&#39;t make sense</li>
<li>Unrealistic expectations. 1. That the product develpment method can be relied upon to guide activities that have nothing to do with product development (finding customers etc). 2. Customer development will move on the same schedule as product development.  &quot;Build it and they will come&quot;. </li>
</ol>

<h3>So what&#39;s the alternative</h3>

<p>Technology lifecycle adoption curve, Everit Rogers, Jeff Moore&#39;s Chasm, key ideas:</p>

<p>Technology is adopted in phases by distinct groups. Tech enthusiasts. Visionaries. Pragmatists. Conservatives. Skeptics. First two groups are the early market. Next two are mainstream. Shape == bell curve. There&#39;s a chasm between the groups, different needs and buying habits. Most of what applies to first group in sales, won&#39;t apply to the second. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a good model for startups. Actual problems for a startup happen far earlier than crossing the chasm between early market and mainstream, so this model is largely irrelevant in the early years of startup. Once you get to the point where it&#39;s relevant, you&#39;re already succeeding.</p>

<p>In reality technology enthusiasts exist, but they rarely buy anything. So sales has to understand them, but they aren&#39;t really a customer group on their own.</p>

<p>The curve makes it feel like overall it&#39;s an execution problem, in practice it&#39;s not, moving between customer types is at best a step function. </p>

<p>So focus shouldn&#39;t be on executing, it should be on learning and development.</p>

<p><strong>Customer development is an alternative to product development</strong></p>

<p>Imagine if engineering said &quot;We&#39;re not going to use any methodology to run our product org&quot;, this would be ridiculous, but we think that&#39;s fine in marketing, sales etc. E.g. &quot;keep it vague then wave your hands a lot when asked how much progress you&#39;re making&quot;. But that&#39;s what often happens in startups.</p>

<p>Customer development says that learning who a startups customers are and what markets they are in, requires it&#39;s own specific process. This is not specifically a sales, marketing or any other department specific thing. Broadly this process cannot be sped up with additional funding, or at least meaningfully so.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2 - The customer development model</h2>

<p>Most startups lack a process for discovering their markets, locating their first customers, validating their assumptions and growing their business.</p>

<p>4 Steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Customer discovery. Focusses on testing whether a companies business model is correct. Whether the product solves customer problems and needs. This is what we think of as product market fit. </li>
<li>Customer validation. Here we develop a sales model that can be repeated and replicated.</li>
<li>Customer creation. Creates and drives end user demand.</li>
<li>Company building. Transitions organisation from one designed for learning and discovery to one that executes</li>
</ol>

<p>Each has specific deliverables. This is not a replacement to product development, it&#39;s a companion to it.</p>

<p>Each step is a circular, recursive step, e.g. involves lots of iterations, not something you do and then it&#39;s done. It only happens in case studies that it all happens in a nice linear way, e.g. have some customer convo&#39;s, find the problems, progress onto the next step.</p>

<p>So each of the 4 steps will require multiple iterations. So it&#39;s OK to screw it up, going back to start of step isn&#39;t a bad thing. E.g. expect to be wrong multiple times on the way to being right.</p>

<p>Without internalising the above, sales, marketing etc tend to move forward without having nailed or understood the market, because they feel like they ought to be moving forward. </p>

<p>(Imagine if we built missiles or pacemakers like this!)</p>

<p>Instead think about the process more like going around and around in circles, gathering momentum, until you achieve escape velocity.</p>

<p>Also fine to move back between stages, e.g. if can&#39;t find enough customers in customer validation stage, then this should send you back to customer discovery.</p>

<p>Part of the goal here is to keep cash burn low until have validated business model.</p>

<p>Having lots of cash often obscures whether or not you&#39;ve found product market fit because you can brute force, give products away etc.</p>

<p>Assume you&#39;ll go through the first couple of steps at least twice. Don&#39;t try and build sales, marketing etc until you&#39;ve gone through these.</p>

<h3>Â Customer Discovery</h3>

<p>Goal is to find out who customers are and whether the product you believe you are solving is important to them. Are the problem, customer and product hypothesis in the business plan correct. &quot;Get outside the building&quot; e.g. can only do this by talking to the customers. Includes who the buyers are, who the daily users are etc. This stage has a lot of influence on how you go onto describe the product in future.</p>

<p><strong>The goal is not to get feature lists. The founders and product org define the initial product, the goal of this stage is to find out whether there is a market for this product.</strong></p>

<p>Someone buying or agreeing to buy (e.g. LOI) is generally the metric here, not customers saying nice things (although these are also interesting).</p>

<h3>Â Customer Validation</h3>

<p>The goal of this process is to build a sales play book, so this is systemising what you&#39;ve learned by selling the product to a few early customers as part of customer discovery. </p>

<h3>Customer Creation</h3>

<p>Builds on success of early sales, goal is to drive demand into the sales org. This sits here because heavy marketing spend etc should sit after customer validation.</p>

<h3>Company building</h3>

<p>Transition from learning orientated organisation to execution orientated, e.g. here start having separate sales, marketing etc orgs which are focussed on own individual missions. Doing this early is one of the most damaging things a startup can do because it reduces runway and so time to learn.</p>

<h3>The four types of markets</h3>

<p>Very different approaches are required depending on whether 1. Bringing new product existing market, 2. Bringing new product into new market, 3. Bringing new product into existing market and trying to resect that market as low cost entrant, 4. Bringing new product into existing market and trying to resect that market as a niche entrant</p>

<p>Disruptive and sustaining innovations are another way to look at this split.</p>

<p>Overall means the strategies that work in one will not work in the other. E.g. whether you&#39;re educating the customer or differentiating. </p>

<p>Example would be Palm v Handspring.</p>

<h4>Bringing new product existing market</h4>

<p>In this market type if effectively offering &quot;better&quot; e.g. higher performance than an existing product which is out there. Market is effectively defined by the competition. But it&#39;s also well understood.</p>

<h4>Bringing new product into new market</h4>

<p>When a company creates a large customer base that couldn&#39;t do something before. Generally true innovation sits here. E.g. first portable computers from Compaq. Features are kind of irrelevant here, instead it&#39;s convincing potential customers that &quot;your vision is not a hallucination&quot;. Cash burn during adoption phase requires planning here.</p>

<h4>Bringing new product into existing market and trying to resect that market as low cost entrant</h4>

<p>Are there customers at the low end of an existing market who would buy good enough performance if they could get it at a substantially lower price. Often fun if can do this profitability because incumbents may tend to abandon the bottom end and move upmarket instead.</p>

<p>This is probably the most common strategy for startups. Often the hardest because low cost needs to be core to product roadmap.</p>

<h4>Bringing new product into existing market and trying to resect that market as a niche entrant</h4>

<p>Would some subset of this market buy a product designed to address their specific needs, event if it cost more or was in some ways worse but not in a way which is important to this niche.</p>

<p>Here positioning will be some of the most challenging.</p>

<h3>Market Types and Customer Development Process</h3>

<p>First step, regardless of market type, is the same, get out of the building and go and talk to customers.</p>

<p>Second step, diverge here, third step (customer creation), diverge even more.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the third step, customer creation, where startups who didn&#39;t do steps one and two properly, spend themselves to death.</p>

<p>Speed of getting through customer development steps varies with market. E.g. type one (product to existing market) may be possible in a few weeks, type 2 (new product new market) much more open ended, will take much longer. E.g. may well take a year or more.</p>

<h3>Syncing product development and customer development</h3>

<p>Customer development is not an alternative to product development. They are two parallel processes which must remain synchronised. </p>

<p>In a large company, engineerings job is to make follow on products for an existing market. A follow on product startups with many things already known. So in a large organisation the interaction between customer development and product development is geared around delivering new features and functionality to new customers at a suitable price point. </p>

<p>In a startup, general guessing at customers. The only certainity on day one is the product vision. So in a startup, typically start with a vision but unknown customers and tailor that to customer feedback. As the market and customers get clearly, product features are driven by how well they satisfy the increasingly clearer market.</p>

<p><strong>In big companies, the product spec is market driven. In startups, the marketing is product driven.</strong></p>

<p>The goal is to ensure customer development and product development work in sync, rather than becoming battlegrounds, e.g. &quot;why did you promise this feature to a customer&quot; vs &quot;what haven&#39;t you built this feature we need to get a deal&quot;.</p>

<p>In Customer Discovery, the goal is to validate the product spec, not to come up with a new set of features. Then if the output of this is that the problem doesn&#39;t exist, isn&#39;t important or the product doesn&#39;t solve it, they reconvene.</p>

<p>When customers have consistently said that feature x is needed, senior product stakeholder should go out and listen to customers, before new features are added.</p>

<p>In customer validation, key product stakeholders go out with pre-sales team.</p>
