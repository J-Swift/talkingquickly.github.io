## Introduction

Two core types of learning:

- Supervised Learning: Where we have a set of outcome data and use these
  outcome data to guide the learning process. The learning process then
  attempts to identify features which will predict this outcome data. A
  good learner will be good at predicting this output data on unseen
  input data.
- Unspervised Learning: We have not outcome data, we are just trying to
  describe how the data is organised or clustered.

Book is primarily about Supervised Learning but touches on Unsupervised
learning later on.

When trying to decide which output labels to apply to input data, e.g.
`spam` or `not_spam`, this is called a classification problem.

## Chapter 2 - Overview of Supervised Learning

Inputs = Predictors = Independent Variables = Features

Outputs = Responses = Dependent Variables
