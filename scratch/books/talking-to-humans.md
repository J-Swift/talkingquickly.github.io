title: Talking To Humans - Book Writeup
---

Read: December 2016

A foreword by Steve Blank, author of "The Four Steps to the Epiphany"
without doubt the bible of modern customer development, is always a
strong recommendation.

The concept of "getting out of the building" being one of the most
important things for an entrepreuneur to do is becoming generally
accepted. That the most important thing to do when designing a product
or a business is to talk to potential customers and understand the
problem from their perspective.

This book deals with the practicalities of how to do this whilst getting
useful information as well as the pervasive misconception that talking
to customers means asking them what they want or if they would buy this.

## Overview

There are two categories of "getting out of the building":

* Talking to customers (the focus of this book)
* Putting people through experiences and observing their behaviour
  (outside of this books scope)

When talking to customers, there are three essential elements:

* Do it yourself. if we're thinking of selling televisons, try and buy
  a television. If we're starting a dog walking service, try and hire
  someone to walk your dog. This helps us clarify and document our own
  decision making process and understand our own motivations. Beware of
  the natural tendancy to give this account too much weight
* Watch someone doing it. The aim is to influence & impact their
  decision making process as little as possible. Here we're trying to
  understand how they behave, what tools do they use, what drives their
  decisions
* Talk to someone who does it. These may well be the same people we
  observe, once they have completed the process. The aim is to clarify
  the observed behaviour, if applicable, and ask questions which delve
  further into their motivations and throught process

All of these are imperfect, but combined will give reliable insights.

## Case Study

Part 1 is a hypothetical case study of two entrepreneurs looking to sell
a new type of pillow. It illustrates core concepts well but as a side
effect is unrealistically "perfect".

## Who

The main focus is on the importance of being opinionated regarding who our
market is. No product is really "for everyone," at least at the start,
so it's essential to identify who are the people who most acutely have
the problem we're solving.

It's then important to look at, within that segment, who the early
adopters are likely to be, because they will form our first customers.

For B2B startups the excellent point is made that "Who" should be
approached from the perspective of the sales process. The person who
wants to buy the product may well be different to the person who
approves the expenditure who may in turn be different to the people who
will use it on a day to day basis.

## What

The focus should always be on validating whatever is currently the
riskiest hypothesis. This is a combination of what is least proven, with
what would have the biggest impact if it was wrong.

The focus should be on stories, not speculation. Probably by favourite
point of the book. People are not good at knowing or articulating their
motivations. Therefore asking speculative questions like "what would
would you do in this scenario" is rarely valuable. Instead encourage
them to tell stories about existing experiences.

General guidelines for questions:

* Open (who, what, why, how) is better than closed (is, are, would, do
  you)
* "What should I have asked that I didn't"
* Instead of asking what would they pay, ask about existing spend, or
  make them think they're actually buying from you now
* "If you could solve any problem, what would it be." Incredibly hard to
  answer but can lead to some interesting insights

Where observation is not possible, concierge mode can achieve something
similar. Here we provide a completely personal 1to1 version of our
product or service to the customer, doing everything manually in exactly
the way they want.

## Interpretation

Before discussion begins, get everyone to write out all the possible
patterns they thing they've seen onto postits and then group them to
structure the conversation.

The aim of talking to customers like this is not statistically
significant data, it's to identify patterns for further experimentation.

The number of people to talk to is almost impossible to define, but
50-100 seems to be a common range, less than this is almost certainly a
mistake (I have mixed feelings about this number).

It is not the customers job to design our product, this data should help
inform the execution of our vision, not dictate it.

## Criticisms

In general a thoroughly worthwhile book. It does however set the reader
up for a fall by focussing on perfect hypothetical scenarios. A market
where you can easily do it yourself, observe and interview and the
resulting data yields clear patterns on the first pass.

Many markets are far from this simple, I'm still searching for something
providing concrete case studies of how real successes in hard to define
markets applied these principles.

## Conclusion

Having listened to many people conducting customer interviews for the
first time, reading this book and applying its contents would almost
certainly prevent a high proportion of the usual mistakes and lead to
substantially more productive conversations.
