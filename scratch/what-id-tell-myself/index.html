        <h1 class="post-title">What I'd Tell Myself</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p><a href="/2015/04/what-id-tell-myself-about-startups/">What I&#39;d tell myself about startups</a> was read by over two hundred thousand people in twenty four hours, republished by <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/startup-advice-2015-4">business insider</a> and translated into three languages (I think). Scary.</p>

<p>It&#39;s become something I re-read almost weekly to remind myself of the mistakes I&#39;m prone to make (seriously, who reads their own writing?). This is a similar attempt to work out if I&#39;ve learned anything about and create a reference for, real life - we all know startups aren&#39;t real life. Usual disclaimers apply, this isn&#39;t advice, you = I, grammar is hard, etc.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Any day when you can say you got a good nights sleep, ate well, did some exercise and spent time with friends, is probably going to be a good one</p></li>
<li><p>Alcohol can be enjoyable but it should never be a tool. If you&#39;re using it to enable something, find out how to do that thing without alcohol</p></li>
<li><p>Most good things, friendships, relationships, business ventures, hobbies, happen slowly. Overnight success should be a red flag</p></li>
<li><p>If something scares you, do it again, and again, and again. There is no shortcut</p></li>
<li><p>Television is dangerously passive, it will suck up an almost unlimited amount of time. Don&#39;t fall asleep watching it</p></li>
<li><p>You really are the sum of the five people you spend most time with, pick these people carefully</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;re one of those five people to somebody else. Try to live up to this</p></li>
<li><p>Goals are fine but reaching them will be an anti climax, the journey is all that matters</p></li>
<li><p>The Office got it right &quot;I wish there was a way to know you&#39;re in the good old days before you&#39;ve actually left them&quot;. Try and be present</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;ll never regret pursuing something you want, be it travel plans or a relationship. There&#39;s nothing worse than knowing you didn&#39;t try</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;re not &quot;never drinking again&quot;. Stop staying that. Have a coffee</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t drink coffee, it&#39;s bad for you</p></li>
<li><p>You can&#39;t fix anyone else problems, you can only support them while they do</p></li>
<li><p>Learn the difference between sympathy and empathy</p></li>
<li><p>Habits are what define who you are. Not just actions but thought chains </p></li>
<li><p>Become aware of what your habits are. Then work out what habits the person you want to be has. If they don&#39;t match, work on that</p></li>
<li><p>Never say &quot;this is going to be my new lifetime habit&quot;. Try it for a week, then two weeks, then a month. See if you like it</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;re going to constantly fail to break habits you dislike and to form new ones you want. That&#39;s OK, if you look carefully, you got a little bit better each time</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re basing an action being OK on somebody else&#39;s behavior or approval, you probably already know it&#39;s not</p></li>
<li><p>Ask for forgiveness not permission, unless someone&#39;s feelings are involved</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t be scared of saying you don&#39;t know something, it&#39;s the fastest way to learn</p></li>
<li><p>If you don&#39;t know what you want to do, change for the sake of change is probably a good bet</p></li>
<li><p>Appearances do matter, how you dress, how you talk and how you stand matters. Read &quot;Thinking Fast Thinking Slow&quot;, most of our judgments of people and situations are subliminal. Accept and, where appropriate, leverage this</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;ll know you&#39;re on the right track when the different &quot;you&#39;s&quot; that different people see, start to converge</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing good ever happens after midnight, if a night isn&#39;t amazing by that time, go home</p></li>
<li><p>A useful heuristic is that if it&#39;s &quot;generally accepted&quot; or &quot;what you&#39;re supposed to do&quot; then it&#39;s probably not a great idea</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing will make you feel worse about yourself than knowing you used somebody. Just don&#39;t do it</p></li>
<li><p>Lists are great, write lots of lists</p></li>
<li><p>Time spent listening to music, reading or exercising is almost always time well spent</p></li>
<li><p>People you have a genuine connection with are rare, whether it&#39;s a friendship or a relationship, put these before everything else</p></li>
