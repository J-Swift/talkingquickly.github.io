Tallinn

Until I flew with Estonian air, I didn't know they made jets this small:

But don't be deceived, the service was impeccable, any airline that hands out complimentary chocolates has my vote.

oooy

- Red Emperor Hostel
- Pita Breads
- Ping pong gangs
- Human Bowling
- Karaoke
- Doesn't really get dark

Riga

- Cinnamon Sallies, Seagull Garett, ???
- Take me to every McDonalds in Riga!
- Sign saying 50 Euro fine for having sex in the hostel(!)
- Woken up by a Frenchman with an accordian (trying to wake my friend up)
- Pancake bar

Vilnius

- What are the odds, a tattoo
- Some of the best bars for meeting people (Mysteria)
- Meat lovers pub, girl on a date, doing body shots 12 hours ago
