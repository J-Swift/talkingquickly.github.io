title: What I'd Tell Myself
---

[What I'd tell myself about startups](/2015/04/what-id-tell-myself-about-startups/) was read by over two hundred thousand people in twenty four hours, republished by [business insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/startup-advice-2015-4) and translated into three languages (I think). Scary.

It's become something I re-read almost weekly to remind myself of the mistakes I'm prone to make (seriously, who reads their own writing?). This is a similar attempt to work out if I've learned anything about and create a reference for, real life - we all know startups aren't real life. Usual disclaimers apply, this isn't advice, you = I, grammar is hard, etc.	

1. Any day when you can say you got a good nights sleep, ate well, did some exercise and spent time with friends, is probably going to be a good one

1. Alcohol can be enjoyable but it should never be a tool. If you're using it to enable something, find out how to do that thing without alcohol

1. Most good things, friendships, relationships, business ventures, hobbies, happen slowly. Overnight success should be a red flag

1. If something scares you, do it again, and again, and again. There is no shortcut

1. Television is dangerously passive, it will suck up an almost unlimited amount of time. Don't fall asleep watching it

1. You really are the sum of the five people you spend most time with, pick these people carefully

1. You're one of those five people to somebody else. Try to live up to this

1. Goals are fine but reaching them will be an anti climax, the journey is all that matters

1. The Office got it right "I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them". Try and be present

1. You'll never regret pursuing something you want, be it travel plans or a relationship. There's nothing worse than knowing you didn't try

1. You're not "never drinking again". Stop staying that. Have a coffee

1. Don't drink coffee, it's bad for you

1. You can't fix anyone else problems, you can only support them while they do

1. Learn the difference between sympathy and empathy

1. Habits are what define who you are. Not just actions but thought chains 

1. Become aware of what your habits are. Then work out what habits the person you want to be has. If they don't match, work on that

1. Never say "this is going to be my new lifetime habit". Try it for a week, then two weeks, then a month. See if you like it

1. You're going to constantly fail to break habits you dislike and to form new ones you want. That's OK, if you look carefully, you got a little bit better each time

1. If you're basing an action being OK on somebody else's behavior or approval, you probably already know it's not

1. Ask for forgiveness not permission, unless someone's feelings are involved

1. Don't be scared of saying you don't know something, it's the fastest way to learn

1. If you don't know what you want to do, change for the sake of change is probably a good bet

1. Appearances do matter, how you dress, how you talk and how you stand matters. Read "Thinking Fast Thinking Slow", most of our judgments of people and situations are subliminal. Accept and, where appropriate, leverage this

1. You'll know you're on the right track when the different "you's" that different people see, start to converge

1. Nothing good ever happens after midnight, if a night isn't amazing by that time, go home

1. A useful heuristic is that if it's "generally accepted" or "what you're supposed to do" then it's probably not a great idea

1. Nothing will make you feel worse about yourself than knowing you used somebody. Just don't do it

1. Lists are great, write lots of lists

1. Time spent listening to music, reading or exercising is almost always time well spent

1. People you have a genuine connection with are rare, whether it's a friendship or a relationship, put these before everything else
