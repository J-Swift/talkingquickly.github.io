            <p>The Omayami Trans bus terminal is just 13km from Ninoy Aquino airport. A simple 35 minute (350peso) journey by taxi. Unless you are making it in rush hour - as we were - in which case I was advised the estimate is 'between an hour an infinity.' So far so good.</p>

            <p>The Czech's truly have turned drinking into an art form, or more specifically, into a sport. Introducing 'The Pub'. It's a lot like a regular Pub in many respects, there is beer, food and people drink said beer. There normalcy ends.</p>

            <p>My approach to travel thus far has been quite simple. Arrive, find things thing to do. Repeat. Flawless and well designed as this process may seem, it can - on occassion - lead to missing things or nearly having to sleep on a beach in the rain. This summers trip to Europe will have a little bit more of a plan. As the more astute among you may have realised, this post is that plan.</p>
