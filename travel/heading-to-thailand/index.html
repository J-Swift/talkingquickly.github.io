        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Somehow my worldly possessions have been reduced to an amount which fits in the backpack I normally carry to work and going by the number of people laughing at the way I eat noodles, I appear to have made it to Bangkok.</p>

<p>Somehow all of this...</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/stuff-on-table.jpg" alt="All of the things"></p>

<p>Fits in here...</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/in-the-bag.jpg" alt="A Bag"></p>

<p>Qatar Airways successfully put any of the European or American airlines I&#39;ve flown with to shame, Champagne after boarding and Cognac after dinner. All in so called &quot;Economy&quot; class. Something of a step up from the usual &quot;abuse by staff on boarding, coffee in lap after microwave pizza&quot; I&#39;ve come to love from Ryan Air.</p>

<p>The most noticeable thing on arrival at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport is SIM Cards. Really. They&#39;re everywhere. The bit of the airport usually reserved for car rentals? Entirely filled with counters selling SIM Cards. The people usually handing out fliers for restaurants at the stations? Handing out free SIMs. Having promised myself no mobile Internet on this trip I felt almost bad refusing.</p>

<h2>The City</h2>

<p>In character it reminds me a lot of Shanghai but with much more outgoing people. In Shanghai people would tend to avert their eyes and avoid interaction with one another at all costs. Here people seem to smile indiscriminately and those who speak English are happy to chat.</p>

<p>In China when we chatted to our waitress or waiter in a restaurant, it was clear we were making them uncomfortable. Here our waitress joined us for drinks and later I was thoroughly beaten at pool by the owner of a local bar. We didn&#39;t understand each other much but concluded he was much better at pool than me (no words needed, I lost by seven balls) and that neither of us liked soccer.</p>

<p>Music seems to be everywhere, there are whole streets of (admittedly quite touristy) bars with nothing but live music. This guy played what may be the best cover of &quot;Dire Straights - Money For Nothing&quot; I&#39;ve ever heard.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/guitar.jpg" alt="Man with Guitar"></p>

<p>On a less touristy note we stumbled on two live music festivals in the first forty eight hours;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/festival.jpg" alt="Festival"></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/drum-band.jpg" alt="Deutsche!"></p>

<p>The food is simply incredible, having ordered red curry with duck at every Thai restaurant or takeout I&#39;ve ever been to, I thought my bar was quite high. Until I had this from a tiny restaurant around the corner from the hostel;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/red-duck-curry.jpg" alt="Red Duck Curry"></p>

<p>This more than made up for discovering that the one thing a canadian, an american, a norweigen and a german have in common is a love of mocking the British;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/only-tourists.jpg" alt="Mocking"></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/ET.jpg" alt="E.T."></p>

<p>In general the city feels safer than I expected, provided dark alleys are avoided. Some friends had someone attempt to snatch their bag, but this was walking down a backstreet to find a hotel that was known for continuing to sell beer well past closing time. So hardly the most savory of areas.</p>

<p>The closest I&#39;ve come to a scary experience was the slightly inebriated policeman who, having failed to catch one of the large fish from the lake in the park with his hands, took to threatening it with a gun whilst grinning and shouting &quot;I James Bond!&quot;</p>

<p>I must admit I didn&#39;t stick around to see how that one ended. My guess is the fish won.</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p>One of my aims with this trip was to see if it really is feasible to spend time working remotely as a developer from here. This means finding out a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the Internet consistent and fast?</li>
<li>Are there nice spots to work?</li>
<li>Is it really as cheap as everyone says?</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as the Internet goes Bangkok is exceptionally good. Internet in the hostel (lub di Silom) being around 20mb downstream. At Launchpad, the co-working space I&#39;ve been using for the last few days, it seems to hover around 0.75mb, perfectly usable but hardly blazing fast.</p>

<p>The space itself is impressive;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/lp-desks.jpg" alt="Desks"></p>

<p>It costs around 320baht (6.20 GBP) for a days access and has enough sofas and beanbags to accommodate my need to nap at lunchtime/ after breakfast/ in the afternoon. I gather from the amused looks when I wake up however that this is not normal behavior.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/lp-sofas.jpg" alt="Sofas"></p>

<p>As far as cost goes the short answer is yes, it really is that cheap. To give a rough benchmark;</p>

<ul>
<li>Meal from a street Vendor; 40 - 100 baht (0.70 - 2 GBP)</li>
<li>Night in a nice hostel; 400 - 600 baht (7.70 - 12 GBP) although by a very lucky quirk, we&#39;re currently paying 50baht (1 GBP) per night!</li>
<li>Local beer in a touristy bar 150 - 300 baht (2 - 4 GBP)</li>
<li>Local beer in a none touristy bar 90 - 150 baht (1 - 2 GBP)</li>
<li>Taxi ride across the city &lt; 100 baht (&lt; 2 GBP)</li>
</ul>

<p>So far so good. As a bonus being seven hours ahead of the UK is meaning I can get a lot of work done while the team in the UK is asleep so it&#39;s ready for them to test in the morning. Starting a little later means it&#39;s still possible to have enough crossover with the English working day that communication isn&#39;t a problem.</p>

<p>I&#39;m expecting the Internet to become far poorer as I move out to the Islands, the dream is a moderately developed island with Bangkok style WiFi. I&#39;m told this is unlikely!</p>

      <a href="/travel/aonang-a-shambles-even-by-my-standards/">Next - Wikitravel furnished me with everything I could possibly need to know about heading south. Get on bus to Krabi, get off bus at Krabi, get in white pickup truck which will take you to Ao Nang, go to Irish pub, they'll tell you where's good to stay.

The words "Irish Pub" should have set little alarm bells ringing. But Ao Nang is the easiest way to get to Tonsai and Railay, two of the best climbing spots in Southeast Asia. So as usually happens I ignored the alarm bells and got in the pickup.

![View from the pickup](/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/pickups.jpg)

I didn't have many expectations of Aonang, but if there's ever something I don't want to step out into, it's something with the atmosphere of Crete.

Some back-story. This summer I decided I needed a quiet break to work on the book, swim in the sea and generally relax. I picked a Greek island based on it being easy to fly to and cheap to rent an apartment with a pool and ended up in Crete.

![View from the Crete](/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/crete.jpg)

As you can see it was beautiful. Just beautiful.

It was also populated entirely by drunken Irishman, families in desperate need of counseling, stag parties and more drunken Irishman. Don't get me wrong I love the Irish, I've also been known to enjoy a stag party. But it turns out arguing families are actually even more of a hindrance to writing than hearing "CANNONBALL!!" followed by the sound of the husband to be collapsing into a hedge.

So when I arrived in Aonang and saw the same dead eyed families shouting in English that they "just want normal coffee" closely followed by the telltale matching t-shirts of a stag party, dismay is putting it lightly.

Continuing with my spectacularly poor decision not to get a data plan in Thailand, a brief spell in a coffee shop with WiFi had the answer. Just head straight to Tonsai. Thirty minutes on a longtail boat and I'd reach one of the most secluded beaches in the area home to a renowned German climbing school. Easy.

Longtail boats have to be seen to be believed. They're essentially a two to four cylinder engine mounted on a ten foot pole with a propeller at the other end. The exposed flywheel and fan belt make the old Seagull outboard we grew up with in Scotland seem positively safe.

![Longtails](/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/longtail.jpg)

On arrival at Tonsai, everything looked promising, in that there was hardly anything there. No real roads, lots of people roped up and climbing, lots of comfortable looking bungalows. After a quick chat in the climbing shop I stopped into the booking office for the bungalows to check there was somewhere to stay for the three nights I needed. Absolutely! As long as I was also happy to stay another seven afterwards. Block bookings only over Christmas. Ah.

The delightfully hippyesque, I believe Eton educated, chap sitting near me confirmed my suspicion that potentially ten days was too long. After ostentatiously lighting a joint and proudly waving it around, he proceeded to look on with disgust at my daring to use a phone. In retrospect I wish I'd pointed out to him that people don't usually iron creases into hippy pants. For anyone who's seen the second inbetweeners movie, yeah, it's that guy.

![That Guy](/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/inbetweeners-guy.jpg)

Upwards and onwards. A quick chat to the woman running the coffee stand and I had a new plan, a brief wade around to the next beach, clamber over the headland then some more wading and I'd be at Railay beach. Slightly more developed so undoubtedly easier to find accommodation. And still good climbing.

Lesson one, "can wade" is not the same as "should wade with backpack". Lesson two, in a climbing area, "clamber" may mean climb.

Railay beach had similar problems, block bookings only over Christmas and New Year. By this point having slept only a few hours the night before, eaten nothing and walked/ climbed/ waded quite a distance, my amusement was beginning to wear off. There may have been slight traces of panic helped by a) the amount of coffee I was drinking to get access to WiFi and b) the onset of heavy rain scuppering my backup plan of sleeping on the beach. 

![Railay Beach](/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/railay-beach.jpg)

I'd stopped giving the plans letters at this stage, but let's call this plan y. Go to the nearest travel bookers and panic buy a ferry ticket to any nearby island while at the same time booking anything available on hostelbookers. Success! There's a van + boat going to Koh Lanta in a few hours. I remember that's one of [Kate McCulley's](http://www.adventurouskate.com/) favorite islands, her blog being one of my original inspirations for wanting to come to Thailand.

The nearest travel booker turns out to be the most helpful woman in Thailand. She suggests a direct boat tomorrow instead and points me towards some bungalows further up the hill which she thinks will be available. "Fan and shower" is her description. I think she's subtly suggesting that it's not fair to get on a boat with others until I've showered. She has a point.

So now for 600 baht (GBP10) I'm sitting in a bungalow made I think almost entirely of wicker and paper mache, having never enjoyed a freezing cold shower more. It even has WiFi. Not the sort that connects to the internet but it's comforting to see the little symbol in the corner of the screen. 

![The Bungalow!](/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/bungalow.jpg)

Even by my standards this was shambolic. Not so much the lack of accommodation, but the lack of talking to other people while in Bangkok to find out what the atmosphere was like in the various places around here before arriving. Or even checking with the hostel in Bangkok how booked up the area was and getting some recommendations.

On the plus side, these guys live outside...

![Monkeys](/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/monkeys.jpg)

They've just switched off the power to the area - no electricity after 10pm - which I think is my cue to stop writing and work out how to put up a mosquito net.
