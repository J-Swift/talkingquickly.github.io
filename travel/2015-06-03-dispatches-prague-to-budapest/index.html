        <h1 class="post-title">Prague - Where drinking truly is a sport</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Date: 03 June 2015<br/>
Location: An AirBnB, Prague<br/>
Status: Eaten a lot of ham<br/>
Trip: <a href="/travel/2015-europe-trip-plan/">Europe Summer 2015</a></p>

<p>The Czech&#39;s truly have turned drinking into an art form, or more specifically, into a sport.</p>

<p>Introducing &quot;The Pub&quot;. It&#39;s a lot like a regular Pub in many respects, there is beer, food and people drink said beer.</p>

<p>It departs from normalcy shortly afterwards. Each table is equipped with four &quot;pour your own&quot; beer pumps. Before pouring, you select the name of the drinker to ensure the volume poured is attributed correctly.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/prague/pumps.jpg" alt="Pour your own beer"></p>

<p>This naturally requires a leader board to track total
consumption. But the Czech&#39;s, who I&#39;m growing to truly love, have taken it one step further.</p>

<p>Projected onto the wall is not just a table by table leader board, but a city by city one.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/prague/leaderboard.jpg%22" alt="Drinking leaderboard"></p>

<p>Two important lessons were learned whilst indulging in this so called
sport:</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually very difficult to pull a pint which isn&#39;t entirely
foam</p>

<ol>
<li>Two Londoners are highly unlikely to secure a place on a leader
board when competing against groups of 6+ Czechs</li>
<li>My favorite part of Prague is still by far the Old Town Square.
Touristy but beautiful. It&#39;s by far the most expensive place to grab a
beer but the sunsets make it worthwhile:</li>
</ol>

<p>And if that&#39;s not enough, there&#39;s an extremely talented Polish man who
waits until shortly after sunset to play with fire:</p>

<p>Having reluctantly bidden farewell to Prague, I&#39;m writing this on what I
can only describe as a hybrid between a train and and a sauna. We could
be in Bratslava but it&#39;s tough to be sure.</p>

<p>The &quot;travel everywhere by bus&quot; plan is largely falling by the wayside.
Trains seem to cost barely more and depart far more frequently.
Although I&#39;ll reserve judgment until this one arrives somewhere
recognisable.</p>

<p><em>Continued 04/06</em></p>

<p>Trains are winning, now safely in Budapest. The day began with a run
along the Danube followed by finding one of the friendliest co-working
spaces I&#39;ve ever encountered.</p>
