            <p>Date: 01 June 2015<br/>
Location: An AirBnB, Prague<br/>
Status: Eaten a lot of ham<br/>
Trip: <a href="/travel/2015-europe-trip-plan/">Europe Summer 2015</a></p>

<p>Amsterdam&#39;s cuisine is exactly what you&#39;d expect for one of the few cities in the world to legalise smoking cannabis. Bitterbollen is a wonderful thing but it&#39;s hard to imagine it being created by somebody not under the influence of something stronger than alcohol.</p>

<p>Prague serves exactly the food you&#39;d expect in a country where the average daily alcohol intake for an adult is 1.5litres of beer. And that&#39;s real beer, not American beer.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/prague/goulash.jpg" alt="Goulash"></p>

<p>This intake may explain why some interactions with the Czech&#39;s can be somewhat stilted, they&#39;re in the throws of a multi year hangover. As our tour guide explained &quot;have you experienced Czech service yet? They don&#39;t hate you, they&#39;re just...Czech.&quot;</p>

<p>On arrival I learned the hard way that &quot;not city center&quot; displayed on the side of a bus means &quot;this bus will go directly to the depot, turn all its lights off and the driver will then go to sleep&quot;.</p>

<p>After some public transport gymnastics and a not entirely intentional walk along the river, I arrived. Feeling good on a solid one hours sleep, 3 Bitterbollen and a Berroca, the hostel directed me to a local restaurant.</p>

<p>Czech food was created for people who were tired, hungover or had recently been subjected to an Easyjet flight. Most things seem to be variations on stews except for the ones which are giant plates of meat. And it&#39;s incredible.</p>

<p>A meal will cost something between two and ten pounds. The price of beer decays exponentially as you move away from the center, peaking at around three pounds with the lowest I&#39;ve seen being about eighty pence. Admittedly that eighty pence was part way through an entirely accidental eight mile walk so I can&#39;t be sure I was still technically in Prague. The locals like to tell you that beer is cheaper than water, which would be funny but for it being fiscally accurate.</p>

<p>Once out of hand, Prague has now taken care of the bachelor party problem by only allowing them into Irish bars. Take a seat near (this is important, near - not in) an Irish bar, grab a beer and indulge in some old fashioned people watching. Once you&#39;ve had your fill, move twenty yards down the road and you&#39;re back to civilisation.</p>

<p>Prague castle is, to say the least, beautiful. If that wasn&#39;t reason enough to visit, it turns out that the spectacular lighting at night, was a <a href="http://praguerevue.com/ViewArticle?articleId=1759">gift from the Rolling Stones</a>.</p>

<p>This began with Jagger saying to President Havel in a bar &quot;Havel, you have such a beautiful castle up there, but you can hardly see it at night.&quot; and the president responding that as a young country, they had higher priorities than lighting up their castle. $32,000 and some moonlighting from the bands lighting designer, and this was rectified.</p>

<p>Yesterday started off with what I can only describe of half a kilo of barbecued ham:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/prague/ham.jpg" alt="A lot of ham"></p>

<p>The resulting food coma meant spending several hours sitting on the edge of a square moving as little as humanly possible. Luckily the entertainment came to us. I&#39;ve no idea what we witnessed, but there was sword fighting:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/prague/swords.jpg" alt="Swords"></p>

<p>Quote of the trip so far, aimed at me, around lunchtime; &quot;you haven&#39;t napped yet today, hopefully you won&#39;t be awake much longer&quot;.</p>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Date: 25 May 2015<br/>
Location: The Flying Pig Uptown, Amsterdam<br/>
Status: Alive<br/>
Trip: <a href="/travel/2015-europe-trip-plan/">Europe Summer 2015</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s always a good sign when a trip begins by losing just one shoe the day before leaving. Armed with what I&#39;m rapidly realising are a not so serviceable pair from Tesco&#39;s for a bargain Â£12, it continued none the less.</p>

<p>Lesson&#39;s were learned almost immediately. Who knew you were supposed to check in for a coach?</p>

<p>Luckily, the emergency &quot;we need to to check in incredibly quickly because the [insert transport method] we&#39;re aiming for is pulling away/ taking off/ sinking&quot; queue is where all of the interesting people are. Here, along with a boarding pass (for a coach? really?), I found a Polish man who shared my love of Aldous Huxley and tepid wine. This promised to be a good journey.</p>

<p>We eventually reached the channel for the ferry crossing and I assembled my customary &quot;bed&quot; out of bar stools, purchased what I&#39;m promised started as a sausage roll and settled in to nap and watch Mash.</p>

<p>Exactly what transpired while I was napping is unclear but I understand it involved my new Polish friend and a litre bottle of Jagermeister. It seems even the Polish can&#39;t drink a litre of Jagermeister emerge unscathed. I believe the remainder of his trip was completed with some assistance from the emergency services. But he did know his Huxley.</p>

<p>One glorious visit to a closed service station later and we made it to Amsterdam. Well somewhere about 30km outside of Amsterdam but beggars and choosers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now perched in the hostel overlooking Vondelpark, surrounded by Germans, and suitably impressed with the wine list:</p>

        <h1 class="post-title">2015 Europe Trip - Planning</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>My approach to travel thus far has been quite simple. Arrive, find things thing to do. Repeat. Flawless and well designed as this process may seem, it can - on occassion - lead to missing things or <a href="/travel/aonang-a-shambles-even-by-my-standards/">nearly having to sleep on a beach in the rain</a>. This summers trip to Europe will have a little bit more of a plan. As the more astute among you may have realised, this post is that plan.</p>

<p>Destinations have been loosely chosen based on European cities which have some sort of a startup scene. I&#39;ll be working while I travel so it&#39;s essential that every one has well established co-working space. I&#39;ll be relying heavily on the amazing <a href="https://copass.org/">Copass</a> for finding these.</p>

<p>The dates and schedule below will almost certainly fall apart within the first week. But the aim is to have a rough framework rather than a day by day plan.</p>

<p>For anyone hoping for another dose of sarcasm like <a href="/travel/aonang-a-shambles-even-by-my-standards/">when it all went wrong in Thailand</a>, you might find this one a little dry - it&#39;s more of something for me to refer to than a blog post. Normal service will be resumed shortly.</p>

<p>The overall trip looks something like this:</p>

<div style="position: relative;margin: 5px 0 5px 0;padding-bottom: 56.25%;height: 0;clear: both;"><iframe style="position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;width: 100%;height: 100%;border: 0;" src="http://www.tripline.net/map?tripId=34625237445010109FD3FB4EE832962B&onSite=0" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

<p><br/></p>

<p>With - I imagine - a sprinkling of random destinations in between.</p>

<p>Dates (subject to constant change) are something like:</p>

<p><a name="amsterdam"></a> </p>

<h1>Amsterdam (Netherlands)</h1>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>The trusty Eurolines overnight bus from London comes it at around Â£30, takes just 11 hours and can&#39;t be beaten. There&#39;s nothing quite like listening to a stag party singing football chants to lull you to sleep.</p>

<h2>Visiting</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.annefrank.org/en/Museum/">Anne Frank House</a> - Museum devoted to the 13 year old Jewish girl who was forced into hiding during the second world war to escape the Nazis. Planning to read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Diary-Young-Girl-Definitive-ebook/dp/B0055N0FZM/">The Diary of Anne Frank</a> before arriving. From April 1 through October 31 open Daily from 9:00 am - 9:00 pm.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.timeout.com/amsterdam/en/attractions-and-museums/stedelijk-museum">The Stedelijk Museum</a> - modern and contemporary art, next to Vondelpark (named after the poet Joost van den Vondel) which is the largest city park in Amsterdam. Sometimes there are free concerts in the open air theatre. Schedule will be announced in <a href="http://www.openluchttheater.nl/programma">mid April</a>.</p>

<h2>Working &amp; Startups</h2>

<p>The most central co-working space seems to be <a href="http://www.thethinkinghut.com/">The Thinking Hut</a> (<a href="https://copass.org/cospaces/the-thinking-hut">copass</a>) on the South East edge of the Canal District.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also <a href="http://www.knowmads.nl/business-partners/greenhouse/">Knowmads Greenhouse</a> (<a href="https://copass.org/cospaces/knowmads-greenhouse">copass</a>) which is within the Knowmads business school.</p>

<p><a href="http://3-beards.com/silicondrinkabout/amsterdam">Sillicon drinkabout Amsterdam</a> may be happening on the Friday.</p>

<h2>Eating</h2>

<p>Raw Herring - I&#39;m told there are food carts selling it everywhere but somehow I&#39;ve never seen it before. Potentially my mind has carefully prevented me from seeing them. Not this time.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/6504/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/2/ppl/1/">St Christophers Inn - The Winston</a> is centrally located and the clear winner on Hostel Bookers. Prices range from EUR37 - EUR50 for dorm rooms which is high but Amsterdam was always going to be expensive. Includes Wifi and Breakfast.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/3445/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/2/ppl/1/">Stayokay Vondelpark</a> is a close second and located right next to Vondelpark and the museum district. Comes in at around EUR35 and includes breakfast, Wifi and a walking tour.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flyingpig.nl/">The Flying Pig</a>; suggested by the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/oldwhitewizard">Old White Wizard</a> also comes highly recommended by <a href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/">Nomadic Matt</a> as does <a href="http://www.bulldoghotel.com/">The Bulldog Hotel</a>.</p>

<p><a name="prague"></a> </p>

<h1>Prague (Czech Republic)</h1>

<p>A city I&#39;ve been to once on a week long holiday but my primary momentos of it are bar crawl tshirts. I&#39;m told there&#39;s some culture there as well.</p>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>Amsterdam to Prague is a bit of a jump, around 17 hours on a bus. That&#39;s excessive even by my standards so this might be the one flight of the trip since it&#39;s only around an hour and a half.</p>

<h2>Visiting</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge">Charles Bridge</a> clue is in the name, a very impressive bridge.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.muzeumkomunismu.cz/en/">The Museum of Communism</a> 9AM - 9PM. Known for presenting a fairly unique insight into what life was like under the Soviet Union.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.karlovylazne.cz/index.php?lang=en">Karlovy Lazne</a> is known for being the largest club in Central Europe. In many ways that sounds like my worst nightmare, but part of me wants to see it.</p>

<p>Little Venice is a small canal district in prague which is a bit like well, Venice.</p>

<p>The island in the Vltava is an Island in the... yeah you get the idea. Known as being a great spot to lie around on the grass not doing all that much.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a huge Nomadic Matt fan and his post on <a href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/four-days-in-prague/">how to spend four days in prague</a> will be my fallback if I run short of things to do.</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p><a href="http://in-spiro.cz/">In Spiro</a> (<a href="https://copass.org/cospaces/in-spiro">copass</a>) looks promising. I can&#39;t read a word of the website but one of the photos includes a pineapple, can&#39;t go far wrong with a pineapple.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/20239/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/3/ppl/1/">Hostel Downtown</a> has a common room with a Piano. So I feel there&#39;s no need to look any further. Around EUR25/ Night.</p>

<p>Piano aside, the <a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/propertyreviews/prp/5256/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/3/ppl/1/">Old Prague Hostel</a> apparently provides unlimited sandwiches and is only EUR17/ night. A tough choice to be made nearer the time.</p>

<p><a name="budapest"></a> </p>

<h1>Budapest (Hungary)</h1>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>Leaving 07:00 arriving Budapest at 14:30. Or 15:00 -&gt; 22:30. About GBP10.</p>

<h2>Visiting</h2>

<p><a href="http://visitbudapest.travel/guide/budapest-attractions/royal-palace/">The Royal Palace &amp; Castle Hill</a> apparently a walking tour is the way to go.</p>

<p><a href="http://welovebudapest.com/shops.and.services.1/sports.and.wellness.2/szechenyi.bath">SzÃ©chenyi Bath</a> is a huge spa complex underpinned by the thermal springs below Budapest.</p>

<p><a href="http://welovebudapest.com/budapest.and.hungary/sights.1/heroes.square">Heroes Square</a> because big squares are cool OK.</p>

<p>A boat trip along the Dabube at night, apparently one of the best ways to see and photograph some of the amazing panoramas the city has to offer.</p>

<p>Climb <a href="http://welovebudapest.com/budapest.and.hungary/sights.1/gellert.hill">Gellert Hill</a>. Because walking and great views are fun.</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.budapest.lofficecoworking.com/index.php?language=en">Loffice Coworking</a> (<a href="https://copass.org/cospaces/loffice-coworking">copass</a>) looks promising. </p>

<p><a href="http://kaptarbudapest.hu/en">Kaptar</a> (<a href="https://copass.org/cospaces/kaptar-coworking-office">copass</a>) also looks interesting. Their focus seems to be heavily on real life communities and people. </p>

<h1>Sofia (Bulgaria)</h1>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>Eurolines from Budapest to Sofia, 12 hours leaving at 6pm, arriving 6am on the 14th. About GBP30. </p>

<h2>Visiting</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://freesofiatour.com/">Free Sofia Walking Tour</a> a free walking tour run by a well regarded none profit.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://nationalartgallerybg.org/index.php?l=4">Museum of Socialist Art</a> contains primarily art from 1944 to 1989 but I&#39;m most interested in the black and white propoganda shorts.</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.betahaus.bg/en/">Betahouse</a> (<a href="https://copass.org/cospaces/betahaus-sofia">copass</a>) looks promising. One of a larger network with spaces in Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/4402/arr/2015-05-14/ngt/3/ppl/1/">Hostel Mostel</a> has exceptionally good reviews and looks to be very reasonably priced, around EUR6 - EUR11 per night. It&#39;s also recommended as one of Nomadic Matts favourite hostels, apparently booking well in advance is recommended.</p>

<p><a name="bucharest"></a> </p>

<h1>Bucharest (Romania)</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.virtualromania.org/places/bucharest.vr/places.vr/">This website</a> has been useful for deciding what to do.</p>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>Probably via train as there doesn&#39;t seem to be a Eurolines service between Sofia and Bucharest. Train appears to take a bit under 10 hours and cost around GBP10.</p>

<h2>Visiting</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Parliament">Palace of Parliament</a> is the largest government building in the world and the second largest building in the world after the Pentagon. As anyone who ever watched the masterpiece that was &quot;big, bigger, biggest&quot; knows, big stuff is cool.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Athenaeum">Romanian Atheneum</a> is a concert hall in the center of Bucharest, tickets are available <a href="http://fge.org.ro/ro/component/jevents/day.listevents/2015/05/21/-.html">here</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitrie_Gusti_National_Village_Museum">The Village Museum</a> is an open air museum containing several hundred wooden houses, windmills, churches and the like. Apparently many of the buildings are genuine and were taken to the museum in pieces and re-assembled.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ci%C8%99migiu_Gardens">CiÈmigiu Gardens</a> - a park in the center of Bucharest. All parks must be visited.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/85694/arr/2015-05-18/ngt/2/ppl/1/">Antique Hostel</a> looks promising and comes in at a bargain EUR10/ night including breakfast. Looks like the right choice if aiming for relaxation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/74966/arr/2015-05-18/ngt/2/ppl/1/">X Hostel</a> More of a party hostel. May win because it has &quot;Escape Room&quot; games for free. Several friends have tried this in London, you have an hour to escape from a room through a combination of gadgets, riddles and puzzles. Unclear exactly what happens if you fail to escape within the allotted hour. I&#39;m envisaging a Star Wars esque trash compactor scenario.</p>

<p><a name="warsaw"></a> </p>

<h1>Warsaw (Poland)</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/top-10-3930.html">This site</a> is useful for choosing things to do.</p>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>Absolutely no idea, there&#39;s no practical way to go directly from Bucharest to Warsaw. Could go via Cluj-Napoca (Romania) up to Kosice (Slovakia) then to Warsaw from there. Spending around a day at each. Eurolines from Bucharest all seem to leave at 5:00AM which means losing a day somewhere so it&#39;s more likely to be trains or, heaven forbid, flights.</p>

<p>Alternatively could return to Budapest which is more of a hub and work it out from there. Because planning.</p>

<h2>Visiting</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/azienki-kr-lewskie-museum-muzeum-azienki-kr-lewskie-3347.html">Åazienki KrÃ³lewskie Museum</a> and <a href="http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/azienki-kr-lewskie-museum-muzeum-azienki-kr-lewskie-3347.html">Åazienki KrÃ³lewskie Park-Palace Complex</a> is a complex of parks and palaces. One of those &quot;great if it&#39;s sunny&quot; type attractions.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/palace-of-culture-and-science-pa-ac-kultury-i-nauki-2036.html">Palace of Culture and Science</a> has the highest viewing platform in Warsaw which should be good for some Panoramas.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/copernicus-science-centre-centrum-nauki-kopernik-160240.html">Copernicus Science Centre</a> is a science museum focussed on letting visitors conduct experiments for themselves. Putting the best part of a day aside for this one.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s sunny then the <a href="http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/multimedia-fountain-park-multimedialny-park-fontann-161002.html">Multimedia Fountain Park</a> looks spectacular, especially at night.</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p><a href="http://clock-work.pl/en/">Clockwork Cowork</a> (<a href="https://copass.org/cospaces/clockwork-cowork">copass</a>). Going by the photos looks like there&#39;s a bit of a hardware slant which is always interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://reaktorwarsaw.com/offer#co-working">Reaktor</a> also looks interesting and with a garden + ping pong, it&#39;s hard to go wrong. There&#39;s talk of weekly startup lunches so might be worth plannig to be around for one of those. Around GBP5/ Day</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/4311/arr/2015-06-17/ngt/3/ppl/1/#fullOverview">Okidoki Hostel</a> has great reviews and comes in at around EUR14/ night. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/6037/arr/2015-06-17/ngt/3/ppl/1/#fullOverview">Tatamka Hostel</a> looks a bit quieter and has kitchen, outdoor area and barbeque. Also comes in at around EUR14/ night.</p>

<p><a name="riga"></a> </p>

<h1>Riga (Latvia)</h1>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>At this point my carefully polished Eurolines bus plan has collapsed completely. Options include &quot;get some trains&quot; and &quot;walk&quot;. It&#39;ll be fine. Given that several sites recommend &quot;going via Russia&quot; and flying is only around Â£60, flying is a definite possibility.</p>

<h2>Seeing</h2>

<p>St.Peterâs churchâs tower in the Old Town is meant to be a great place to get panoramas of the city.</p>

<p>Riga Black Balsam Bar in the Old Town serves a traditional drink called, oddly, Riga Black Balsam which is an alcoholic drink one should apparently not leave without trying.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/latvia/riga/sights/landmarks-monuments/freedom-monument">Freedom Monument</a> which somehow avoided demolition during the Soviet years.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/latvia/riga/sights/museums-galleries/riga-motor-museum">Riga Motor Museum</a> for exhibits like Stalin&#39;s 7 tonne armored limousine.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/latvia/riga/activities/other/regro-s">Regros</a> a Soviet Fallout shelter where you can fire guns. What&#39;s not to love?</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p>My home in London (Techhub) has an <a href="https://riga.techhub.com/">office in Riga</a>, so there&#39;s no competition here.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/3512/arr/2015-06-17/ngt/2/ppl/1/">The Naughty Squirrel Backpackers</a>. They had me at the name but as if more was needed, to quote their about page: &quot;Daily activities include AK Shooting, Bobsled, Free Walking Tours, Pub Crawls, Latvian Food Nights, Karaoke, Husky Dog Sledding, Daily Happy Hours, Latvian Beer Tastings&quot;. Expensive at EUR17/ night. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/97531/arr/2015-06-17/ngt/2/ppl/1/">Seagulls Garret Hostel</a> also looks promising and is a much easier 9EUR/ night.</p>

<p><a name="tallinn"></a> </p>

<h1>Tallinn (Estonia)</h1>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>And we&#39;re back in the game (of getting buses everywhere that is). <a href="http://www.luxexpress.eu/en/tallinn-riga">Lux Express</a> takes 4 and a half hours to get from Riga to Tallinn, it only costs EUR16 and there are several per day. Luxury.</p>

<h2>Seeing</h2>

<p>My Tallinn expert is the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/GPat_UK">@GPat_Uk</a> who suggests:</p>

<p>For dinner - the Nordic hotel has the most ridiculous food. Like Michelin-star esque and not very expensive.</p>

<p>Elephant - good Indian</p>

<p>Pepparsack - GREAT meat and sometimes swordfighting</p>

<p>Make sure to drink a millimailakas</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p><a href="http://hub.garage48.org/">Garage48</a> comes in at a bargain EUR6/ day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coworking.ee/">http://www.coworking.ee/</a> is just EUR5/ Day and the pictures include a typewriter. Touch choice.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.tallinnbackpackers.com/">Tallin Backpackers</a> (<a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/hostels/estonia/tallinn/31456/">hostel bookers</a>) is recommended by Nomadic Matt.</p>

<p><a href="http://euphoria.traveller.ee/">Euphoria</a> also looks promising for a more relaxed stay.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title">Arriving in Aonang, a shambles even by my standards</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Wikitravel furnished me with everything I could possibly need to know about heading south. Get on bus to Krabi, get off bus at Krabi, get in white pickup truck which will take you to Ao Nang, go to Irish pub, they&#39;ll tell you where&#39;s good to stay.</p>

<p>The words &quot;Irish Pub&quot; should have set little alarm bells ringing. But Ao Nang is the easiest way to get to Tonsai and Railay, two of the best climbing spots in Southeast Asia. So as usually happens I ignored the alarm bells and got in the pickup.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/pickups.jpg" alt="View from the pickup"></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t have many expectations of Aonang, but if there&#39;s ever something I don&#39;t want to step out into, it&#39;s something with the atmosphere of Crete.</p>

<p>Some back-story. This summer I decided I needed a quiet break to work on the book, swim in the sea and generally relax. I picked a Greek island based on it being easy to fly to and cheap to rent an apartment with a pool and ended up in Crete.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/crete.jpg" alt="View from the Crete"></p>

<p>As you can see it was beautiful. Just beautiful.</p>

<p>It was also populated entirely by drunken Irishman, families in desperate need of counseling, stag parties and more drunken Irishman. Don&#39;t get me wrong I love the Irish, I&#39;ve also been known to enjoy a stag party. But it turns out arguing families are actually even more of a hindrance to writing than hearing &quot;CANNONBALL!!&quot; followed by the sound of the husband to be collapsing into a hedge.</p>

<p>So when I arrived in Aonang and saw the same dead eyed families shouting in English that they &quot;just want normal coffee&quot; closely followed by the telltale matching t-shirts of a stag party, dismay is putting it lightly.</p>

<p>Continuing with my spectacularly poor decision not to get a data plan in Thailand, a brief spell in a coffee shop with WiFi had the answer. Just head straight to Tonsai. Thirty minutes on a longtail boat and I&#39;d reach one of the most secluded beaches in the area home to a renowned German climbing school. Easy.</p>

<p>Longtail boats have to be seen to be believed. They&#39;re essentially a two to four cylinder engine mounted on a ten foot pole with a propeller at the other end. The exposed flywheel and fan belt make the old Seagull outboard we grew up with in Scotland seem positively safe.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/longtail.jpg" alt="Longtails"></p>

<p>On arrival at Tonsai, everything looked promising, in that there was hardly anything there. No real roads, lots of people roped up and climbing, lots of comfortable looking bungalows. After a quick chat in the climbing shop I stopped into the booking office for the bungalows to check there was somewhere to stay for the three nights I needed. Absolutely! As long as I was also happy to stay another seven afterwards. Block bookings only over Christmas. Ah.</p>

<p>The delightfully hippyesque, I believe Eton educated, chap sitting near me confirmed my suspicion that potentially ten days was too long. After ostentatiously lighting a joint and proudly waving it around, he proceeded to look on with disgust at my daring to use a phone. In retrospect I wish I&#39;d pointed out to him that people don&#39;t usually iron creases into hippy pants. For anyone who&#39;s seen the second inbetweeners movie, yeah, it&#39;s that guy.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/inbetweeners-guy.jpg" alt="That Guy"></p>

<p>Upwards and onwards. A quick chat to the woman running the coffee stand and I had a new plan, a brief wade around to the next beach, clamber over the headland then some more wading and I&#39;d be at Railay beach. Slightly more developed so undoubtedly easier to find accommodation. And still good climbing.</p>

<p>Lesson one, &quot;can wade&quot; is not the same as &quot;should wade with backpack&quot;. Lesson two, in a climbing area, &quot;clamber&quot; may mean climb.</p>

<p>Railay beach had similar problems, block bookings only over Christmas and New Year. By this point having slept only a few hours the night before, eaten nothing and walked/ climbed/ waded quite a distance, my amusement was beginning to wear off. There may have been slight traces of panic helped by a) the amount of coffee I was drinking to get access to WiFi and b) the onset of heavy rain scuppering my backup plan of sleeping on the beach. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/railay-beach.jpg" alt="Railay Beach"></p>

<p>I&#39;d stopped giving the plans letters at this stage, but let&#39;s call this plan y. Go to the nearest travel bookers and panic buy a ferry ticket to any nearby island while at the same time booking anything available on hostelbookers. Success! There&#39;s a van + boat going to Koh Lanta in a few hours. I remember that&#39;s one of <a href="http://www.adventurouskate.com/">Kate McCulley&#39;s</a> favorite islands, her blog being one of my original inspirations for wanting to come to Thailand.</p>

<p>The nearest travel booker turns out to be the most helpful woman in Thailand. She suggests a direct boat tomorrow instead and points me towards some bungalows further up the hill which she thinks will be available. &quot;Fan and shower&quot; is her description. I think she&#39;s subtly suggesting that it&#39;s not fair to get on a boat with others until I&#39;ve showered. She has a point.</p>

<p>So now for 600 baht (GBP10) I&#39;m sitting in a bungalow made I think almost entirely of wicker and paper mache, having never enjoyed a freezing cold shower more. It even has WiFi. Not the sort that connects to the internet but it&#39;s comforting to see the little symbol in the corner of the screen. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/bungalow.jpg" alt="The Bungalow!"></p>

<p>Even by my standards this was shambolic. Not so much the lack of accommodation, but the lack of talking to other people while in Bangkok to find out what the atmosphere was like in the various places around here before arriving. Or even checking with the hostel in Bangkok how booked up the area was and getting some recommendations.</p>

<p>On the plus side, these guys live outside...</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/monkeys.jpg" alt="Monkeys"></p>

<p>They&#39;ve just switched off the power to the area - no electricity after 10pm - which I think is my cue to stop writing and work out how to put up a mosquito net.</p>

            <p>Somehow my worldly possessions have been reduced to an amount which fits in the backpack I normally carry to work and going by the number of people laughing at the way I eat noodles, I appear to have made it to Bangkok.</p>

<p>Somehow all of this...</p>

<p>Qatar Airways successfully put any of the European or American airlines I&#39;ve flown with to shame, Champagne after boarding and Cognac after dinner. All in so called &quot;Economy&quot; class. Something of a step up from the usual &quot;abuse by staff on boarding, coffee in lap after microwave pizza&quot; I&#39;ve come to love from Ryan Air.</p>

<p>The most noticeable thing on arrival at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport is SIM Cards. Really. They&#39;re everywhere. The bit of the airport usually reserved for car rentals? Entirely filled with counters selling SIM Cards. The people usually handing out fliers for restaurants at the stations? Handing out free SIMs. Having promised myself no mobile Internet on this trip I felt almost bad refusing.</p>

<h2>The City</h2>

<p>In character it reminds me a lot of Shanghai but with much more outgoing people. In Shanghai people would tend to avert their eyes and avoid interaction with one another at all costs. Here people seem to smile indiscriminately and those who speak English are happy to chat.</p>

<p>In China when we chatted to our waitress or waiter in a restaurant, it was clear we were making them uncomfortable. Here our waitress joined us for drinks and later I was thoroughly beaten at pool by the owner of a local bar. We didn&#39;t understand each other much but concluded he was much better at pool than me (no words needed, I lost by seven balls) and that neither of us liked soccer.</p>

<p>Music seems to be everywhere, there are whole streets of (admittedly quite touristy) bars with nothing but live music. This guy played what may be the best cover of &quot;Dire Straights - Money For Nothing&quot; I&#39;ve ever heard.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/guitar.jpg" alt="Man with Guitar"></p>

<p>On a less touristy note we stumbled on two live music festivals in the first forty eight hours;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/festival.jpg" alt="Festival"></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/drum-band.jpg" alt="Deutsche!"></p>

<p>The food is simply incredible, having ordered red curry with duck at every Thai restaurant or takeout I&#39;ve ever been to, I thought my bar was quite high. Until I had this from a tiny restaurant around the corner from the hostel;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/red-duck-curry.jpg" alt="Red Duck Curry"></p>

<p>This more than made up for discovering that the one thing a canadian, an american, a norweigen and a german have in common is a love of mocking the British;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/ET.jpg" alt="E.T."></p>

<p>In general the city feels safer than I expected, provided dark alleys are avoided. Some friends had someone attempt to snatch their bag, but this was walking down a backstreet to find a hotel that was known for continuing to sell beer well past closing time. So hardly the most savory of areas.</p>

<p>The closest I&#39;ve come to a scary experience was the slightly inebriated policeman who, having failed to catch one of the large fish from the lake in the park with his hands, took to threatening it with a gun whilst grinning and shouting &quot;I James Bond!&quot;</p>

<p>I must admit I didn&#39;t stick around to see how that one ended. My guess is the fish won.</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p>One of my aims with this trip was to see if it really is feasible to spend time working remotely as a developer from here. This means finding out a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the Internet consistent and fast?</li>
<li>Are there nice spots to work?</li>
<li>Is it really as cheap as everyone says?</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as the Internet goes Bangkok is exceptionally good. Internet in the hostel (lub di Silom) being around 20mb downstream. At Launchpad, the co-working space I&#39;ve been using for the last few days, it seems to hover around 0.75mb, perfectly usable but hardly blazing fast.</p>

<p>The space itself is impressive;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/lp-desks.jpg" alt="Desks"></p>

<p>It costs around 320baht (6.20 GBP) for a days access and has enough sofas and beanbags to accommodate my need to nap at lunchtime/ after breakfast/ in the afternoon. I gather from the amused looks when I wake up however that this is not normal behavior.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/heading-to-thailand/lp-sofas.jpg" alt="Sofas"></p>

<p>As far as cost goes the short answer is yes, it really is that cheap. To give a rough benchmark;</p>

<ul>
<li>Meal from a street Vendor; 40 - 100 baht (0.70 - 2 GBP)</li>
<li>Night in a nice hostel; 400 - 600 baht (7.70 - 12 GBP) although by a very lucky quirk, we&#39;re currently paying 50baht (1 GBP) per night!</li>
<li>Local beer in a touristy bar 150 - 300 baht (2 - 4 GBP)</li>
<li>Local beer in a none touristy bar 90 - 150 baht (1 - 2 GBP)</li>
<li>Taxi ride across the city &lt; 100 baht (&lt; 2 GBP)</li>
</ul>

<p>So far so good. As a bonus being seven hours ahead of the UK is meaning I can get a lot of work done while the team in the UK is asleep so it&#39;s ready for them to test in the morning. Starting a little later means it&#39;s still possible to have enough crossover with the English working day that communication isn&#39;t a problem.</p>

<p>I&#39;m expecting the Internet to become far poorer as I move out to the Islands, the dream is a moderately developed island with Bangkok style WiFi. I&#39;m told this is unlikely!</p>

      <a href="/travel/aonang-a-shambles-even-by-my-standards/">Next - Wikitravel furnished me with everything I could possibly need to know about heading south. Get on bus to Krabi, get off bus at Krabi, get in white pickup truck which will take you to Ao Nang, go to Irish pub, they'll tell you where's good to stay.

The words "Irish Pub" should have set little alarm bells ringing. But Ao Nang is the easiest way to get to Tonsai and Railay, two of the best climbing spots in Southeast Asia. So as usually happens I ignored the alarm bells and got in the pickup.

![View from the pickup](/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/pickups.jpg)

I didn't have many expectations of Aonang, but if there's ever something I don't want to step out into, it's something with the atmosphere of Crete.

Some back-story. This summer I decided I needed a quiet break to work on the book, swim in the sea and generally relax. I picked a Greek island based on it being easy to fly to and cheap to rent an apartment with a pool and ended up in Crete.

![View from the Crete](/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/crete.jpg)

As you can see it was beautiful. Just beautiful.

It was also populated entirely by drunken Irishman, families in desperate need of counseling, stag parties and more drunken Irishman. Don't get me wrong I love the Irish, I've also been known to enjoy a stag party. But it turns out arguing families are actually even more of a hindrance to writing than hearing "CANNONBALL!!" followed by the sound of the husband to be collapsing into a hedge.

So when I arrived in Aonang and saw the same dead eyed families shouting in English that they "just want normal coffee" closely followed by the telltale matching t-shirts of a stag party, dismay is putting it lightly.

Continuing with my spectacularly poor decision not to get a data plan in Thailand, a brief spell in a coffee shop with WiFi had the answer. Just head straight to Tonsai. Thirty minutes on a longtail boat and I'd reach one of the most secluded beaches in the area home to a renowned German climbing school. Easy.

Longtail boats have to be seen to be believed. They're essentially a two to four cylinder engine mounted on a ten foot pole with a propeller at the other end. The exposed flywheel and fan belt make the old Seagull outboard we grew up with in Scotland seem positively safe.

![Longtails](/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/longtail.jpg)

On arrival at Tonsai, everything looked promising, in that there was hardly anything there. No real roads, lots of people roped up and climbing, lots of comfortable looking bungalows. After a quick chat in the climbing shop I stopped into the booking office for the bungalows to check there was somewhere to stay for the three nights I needed. Absolutely! As long as I was also happy to stay another seven afterwards. Block bookings only over Christmas. Ah.

The delightfully hippyesque, I believe Eton educated, chap sitting near me confirmed my suspicion that potentially ten days was too long. After ostentatiously lighting a joint and proudly waving it around, he proceeded to look on with disgust at my daring to use a phone. In retrospect I wish I'd pointed out to him that people don't usually iron creases into hippy pants. For anyone who's seen the second inbetweeners movie, yeah, it's that guy.

![That Guy](/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/inbetweeners-guy.jpg)

Upwards and onwards. A quick chat to the woman running the coffee stand and I had a new plan, a brief wade around to the next beach, clamber over the headland then some more wading and I'd be at Railay beach. Slightly more developed so undoubtedly easier to find accommodation. And still good climbing.

Lesson one, "can wade" is not the same as "should wade with backpack". Lesson two, in a climbing area, "clamber" may mean climb.

Railay beach had similar problems, block bookings only over Christmas and New Year. By this point having slept only a few hours the night before, eaten nothing and walked/ climbed/ waded quite a distance, my amusement was beginning to wear off. There may have been slight traces of panic helped by a) the amount of coffee I was drinking to get access to WiFi and b) the onset of heavy rain scuppering my backup plan of sleeping on the beach. 

![Railay Beach](/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/railay-beach.jpg)

I'd stopped giving the plans letters at this stage, but let's call this plan y. Go to the nearest travel bookers and panic buy a ferry ticket to any nearby island while at the same time booking anything available on hostelbookers. Success! There's a van + boat going to Koh Lanta in a few hours. I remember that's one of [Kate McCulley's](http://www.adventurouskate.com/) favorite islands, her blog being one of my original inspirations for wanting to come to Thailand.

The nearest travel booker turns out to be the most helpful woman in Thailand. She suggests a direct boat tomorrow instead and points me towards some bungalows further up the hill which she thinks will be available. "Fan and shower" is her description. I think she's subtly suggesting that it's not fair to get on a boat with others until I've showered. She has a point.

So now for 600 baht (GBP10) I'm sitting in a bungalow made I think almost entirely of wicker and paper mache, having never enjoyed a freezing cold shower more. It even has WiFi. Not the sort that connects to the internet but it's comforting to see the little symbol in the corner of the screen. 

![The Bungalow!](/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/bungalow.jpg)

Even by my standards this was shambolic. Not so much the lack of accommodation, but the lack of talking to other people while in Bangkok to find out what the atmosphere was like in the various places around here before arriving. Or even checking with the hostel in Bangkok how booked up the area was and getting some recommendations.

On the plus side, these guys live outside...

![Monkeys](/assets/images/travel/shambles-even-by-my-standards/monkeys.jpg)

They've just switched off the power to the area - no electricity after 10pm - which I think is my cue to stop writing and work out how to put up a mosquito net.

  &lt;a href=&quot;/travel/2015-europe-trip-plan/&quot;&gt;Next - My approach to travel thus far has been quite simple. Arrive, find things thing to do. Repeat. Flawless and well designed as this process may seem, it can - on occassion - lead to missing things or [nearly having to sleep on a beach in the rain](/travel/aonang-a-shambles-even-by-my-standards/). This summers trip to Europe will have a little bit more of a plan. As the more astute among you may have realised, this post is that plan.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Destinations have been loosely chosen based on European cities which have some sort of a startup scene. I&#39;ll be working while I travel so it&#39;s essential that every one has well established co-working space. I&#39;ll be relying heavily on the amazing <a href="https://copass.org/">Copass</a> for finding these.</p>

<p>The dates and schedule below will almost certainly fall apart within the first week. But the aim is to have a rough framework rather than a day by day plan.</p>

<p>For anyone hoping for another dose of sarcasm like <a href="/travel/aonang-a-shambles-even-by-my-standards/">when it all went wrong in Thailand</a>, you might find this one a little dry - it&#39;s more of something for me to refer to than a blog post. Normal service will be resumed shortly.</p>

<p>The overall trip looks something like this:</p>

<div style="position: relative;margin: 5px 0 5px 0;padding-bottom: 56.25%;height: 0;clear: both;"><iframe style="position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;width: 100%;height: 100%;border: 0;" src="http://www.tripline.net/map?tripId=34625237445010109FD3FB4EE832962B&onSite=0" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

<p><br/></p>

<p>With - I imagine - a sprinkling of random destinations in between.</p>

<p>Dates (subject to constant change) are something like:</p>

<h1>Amsterdam (Netherlands)</h1>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>The trusty Eurolines overnight bus from London comes it at around Â£30, takes just 11 hours and can&#39;t be beaten. There&#39;s nothing quite like listening to a stag party singing football chants to lull you to sleep.</p>

<h2>Visiting</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.annefrank.org/en/Museum/">Anne Frank House</a> - Museum devoted to the 13 year old Jewish girl who was forced into hiding during the second world war to escape the Nazis. Planning to read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Diary-Young-Girl-Definitive-ebook/dp/B0055N0FZM/">The Diary of Anne Frank</a> before arriving. From April 1 through October 31 open Daily from 9:00 am - 9:00 pm.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.timeout.com/amsterdam/en/attractions-and-museums/stedelijk-museum">The Stedelijk Museum</a> - modern and contemporary art, next to Vondelpark (named after the poet Joost van den Vondel) which is the largest city park in Amsterdam. Sometimes there are free concerts in the open air theatre. Schedule will be announced in <a href="http://www.openluchttheater.nl/programma">mid April</a>.</p>

<h2>Working &amp; Startups</h2>

<p>The most central co-working space seems to be <a href="http://www.thethinkinghut.com/">The Thinking Hut</a> (<a href="https://copass.org/cospaces/the-thinking-hut">copass</a>) on the South East edge of the Canal District.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also <a href="http://www.knowmads.nl/business-partners/greenhouse/">Knowmads Greenhouse</a> (<a href="https://copass.org/cospaces/knowmads-greenhouse">copass</a>) which is within the Knowmads business school.</p>

<p><a href="http://3-beards.com/silicondrinkabout/amsterdam">Sillicon drinkabout Amsterdam</a> may be happening on the Friday.</p>

<h2>Eating</h2>

<p>Raw Herring - I&#39;m told there are food carts selling it everywhere but somehow I&#39;ve never seen it before. Potentially my mind has carefully prevented me from seeing them. Not this time.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/6504/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/2/ppl/1/">St Christophers Inn - The Winston</a> is centrally located and the clear winner on Hostel Bookers. Prices range from EUR37 - EUR50 for dorm rooms which is high but Amsterdam was always going to be expensive. Includes Wifi and Breakfast.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/3445/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/2/ppl/1/">Stayokay Vondelpark</a> is a close second and located right next to Vondelpark and the museum district. Comes in at around EUR35 and includes breakfast, Wifi and a walking tour.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flyingpig.nl/">The Flying Pig</a>; suggested by the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/oldwhitewizard">Old White Wizard</a> also comes highly recommended by <a href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/">Nomadic Matt</a> as does <a href="http://www.bulldoghotel.com/">The Bulldog Hotel</a>.</p>

<p><a name="prague"></a> </p>

<h1>Prague (Czech Republic)</h1>

<p>A city I&#39;ve been to once on a week long holiday but my primary momentos of it are bar crawl tshirts. I&#39;m told there&#39;s some culture there as well.</p>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>Amsterdam to Prague is a bit of a jump, around 17 hours on a bus. That&#39;s excessive even by my standards so this might be the one flight of the trip since it&#39;s only around an hour and a half.</p>

<h2>Visiting</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge">Charles Bridge</a> clue is in the name, a very impressive bridge.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.muzeumkomunismu.cz/en/">The Museum of Communism</a> 9AM - 9PM. Known for presenting a fairly unique insight into what life was like under the Soviet Union.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.karlovylazne.cz/index.php?lang=en">Karlovy Lazne</a> is known for being the largest club in Central Europe. In many ways that sounds like my worst nightmare, but part of me wants to see it.</p>

<p>Little Venice is a small canal district in prague which is a bit like well, Venice.</p>

<p>The island in the Vltava is an Island in the... yeah you get the idea. Known as being a great spot to lie around on the grass not doing all that much.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a huge Nomadic Matt fan and his post on <a href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/four-days-in-prague/">how to spend four days in prague</a> will be my fallback if I run short of things to do.</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p><a href="http://in-spiro.cz/">In Spiro</a> (<a href="https://copass.org/cospaces/in-spiro">copass</a>) looks promising. I can&#39;t read a word of the website but one of the photos includes a pineapple, can&#39;t go far wrong with a pineapple.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/20239/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/3/ppl/1/">Hostel Downtown</a> has a common room with a Piano. So I feel there&#39;s no need to look any further. Around EUR25/ Night.</p>

<p>Piano aside, the <a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/propertyreviews/prp/5256/arr/2015-05-06/ngt/3/ppl/1/">Old Prague Hostel</a> apparently provides unlimited sandwiches and is only EUR17/ night. A tough choice to be made nearer the time.</p>

<h1>Budapest (Hungary)</h1>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>Leaving 07:00 arriving Budapest at 14:30. Or 15:00 -&gt; 22:30. About GBP10.</p>

<h2>Visiting</h2>

<p><a href="http://visitbudapest.travel/guide/budapest-attractions/royal-palace/">The Royal Palace &amp; Castle Hill</a> apparently a walking tour is the way to go.</p>

<p><a href="http://welovebudapest.com/shops.and.services.1/sports.and.wellness.2/szechenyi.bath">SzÃ©chenyi Bath</a> is a huge spa complex underpinned by the thermal springs below Budapest.</p>

<p><a href="http://welovebudapest.com/budapest.and.hungary/sights.1/heroes.square">Heroes Square</a> because big squares are cool OK.</p>

<p>A boat trip along the Dabube at night, apparently one of the best ways to see and photograph some of the amazing panoramas the city has to offer.</p>

<p>Climb <a href="http://welovebudapest.com/budapest.and.hungary/sights.1/gellert.hill">Gellert Hill</a>. Because walking and great views are fun.</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.budapest.lofficecoworking.com/index.php?language=en">Loffice Coworking</a> (<a href="https://copass.org/cospaces/loffice-coworking">copass</a>) looks promising. </p>

<p><a href="http://kaptarbudapest.hu/en">Kaptar</a> (<a href="https://copass.org/cospaces/kaptar-coworking-office">copass</a>) also looks interesting. Their focus seems to be heavily on real life communities and people. </p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/propertyreviews/prp/29071/arr/2015-05-09/ngt/6/ppl/1/">Home Plus Hostel</a> offers free dinners three times a week. Which is hard to beat.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/propertyreviews/prp/4308/arr/2015-05-09/ngt/6/ppl/1/">Astoria City Hostel</a> has impressive reviews and most importantly a kitchen. By this point there&#39;s a good chance I&#39;ll be missing cooking for myself.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g274887-d577388-Reviews-Aboriginal_Hostel-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html">Aboriginal</a> is meant to have an amazing atmosphere. </p>

<p><a name="sofia"></a> </p>

<h1>Sofia (Bulgaria)</h1>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>Eurolines from Budapest to Sofia, 12 hours leaving at 6pm, arriving 6am on the 14th. About GBP30. </p>

<h2>Visiting</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://freesofiatour.com/">Free Sofia Walking Tour</a> a free walking tour run by a well regarded none profit.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://nationalartgallerybg.org/index.php?l=4">Museum of Socialist Art</a> contains primarily art from 1944 to 1989 but I&#39;m most interested in the black and white propoganda shorts.</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.betahaus.bg/en/">Betahouse</a> (<a href="https://copass.org/cospaces/betahaus-sofia">copass</a>) looks promising. One of a larger network with spaces in Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/4402/arr/2015-05-14/ngt/3/ppl/1/">Hostel Mostel</a> has exceptionally good reviews and looks to be very reasonably priced, around EUR6 - EUR11 per night. It&#39;s also recommended as one of Nomadic Matts favourite hostels, apparently booking well in advance is recommended.</p>

<p><a name="bucharest"></a> </p>

<h1>Bucharest (Romania)</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.virtualromania.org/places/bucharest.vr/places.vr/">This website</a> has been useful for deciding what to do.</p>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>Probably via train as there doesn&#39;t seem to be a Eurolines service between Sofia and Bucharest. Train appears to take a bit under 10 hours and cost around GBP10.</p>

<h2>Visiting</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Parliament">Palace of Parliament</a> is the largest government building in the world and the second largest building in the world after the Pentagon. As anyone who ever watched the masterpiece that was &quot;big, bigger, biggest&quot; knows, big stuff is cool.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Athenaeum">Romanian Atheneum</a> is a concert hall in the center of Bucharest, tickets are available <a href="http://fge.org.ro/ro/component/jevents/day.listevents/2015/05/21/-.html">here</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitrie_Gusti_National_Village_Museum">The Village Museum</a> is an open air museum containing several hundred wooden houses, windmills, churches and the like. Apparently many of the buildings are genuine and were taken to the museum in pieces and re-assembled.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ci%C8%99migiu_Gardens">CiÈmigiu Gardens</a> - a park in the center of Bucharest. All parks must be visited.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/85694/arr/2015-05-18/ngt/2/ppl/1/">Antique Hostel</a> looks promising and comes in at a bargain EUR10/ night including breakfast. Looks like the right choice if aiming for relaxation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/74966/arr/2015-05-18/ngt/2/ppl/1/">X Hostel</a> More of a party hostel. May win because it has &quot;Escape Room&quot; games for free. Several friends have tried this in London, you have an hour to escape from a room through a combination of gadgets, riddles and puzzles. Unclear exactly what happens if you fail to escape within the allotted hour. I&#39;m envisaging a Star Wars esque trash compactor scenario.</p>

<p><a name="warsaw"></a> </p>

<h1>Warsaw (Poland)</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/top-10-3930.html">This site</a> is useful for choosing things to do.</p>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>Absolutely no idea, there&#39;s no practical way to go directly from Bucharest to Warsaw. Could go via Cluj-Napoca (Romania) up to Kosice (Slovakia) then to Warsaw from there. Spending around a day at each. Eurolines from Bucharest all seem to leave at 5:00AM which means losing a day somewhere so it&#39;s more likely to be trains or, heaven forbid, flights.</p>

<p>Alternatively could return to Budapest which is more of a hub and work it out from there. Because planning.</p>

<h2>Visiting</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/azienki-kr-lewskie-museum-muzeum-azienki-kr-lewskie-3347.html">Åazienki KrÃ³lewskie Museum</a> and <a href="http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/azienki-kr-lewskie-museum-muzeum-azienki-kr-lewskie-3347.html">Åazienki KrÃ³lewskie Park-Palace Complex</a> is a complex of parks and palaces. One of those &quot;great if it&#39;s sunny&quot; type attractions.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/palace-of-culture-and-science-pa-ac-kultury-i-nauki-2036.html">Palace of Culture and Science</a> has the highest viewing platform in Warsaw which should be good for some Panoramas.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/copernicus-science-centre-centrum-nauki-kopernik-160240.html">Copernicus Science Centre</a> is a science museum focussed on letting visitors conduct experiments for themselves. Putting the best part of a day aside for this one.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s sunny then the <a href="http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/multimedia-fountain-park-multimedialny-park-fontann-161002.html">Multimedia Fountain Park</a> looks spectacular, especially at night.</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p><a href="http://clock-work.pl/en/">Clockwork Cowork</a> (<a href="https://copass.org/cospaces/clockwork-cowork">copass</a>). Going by the photos looks like there&#39;s a bit of a hardware slant which is always interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://reaktorwarsaw.com/offer#co-working">Reaktor</a> also looks interesting and with a garden + ping pong, it&#39;s hard to go wrong. There&#39;s talk of weekly startup lunches so might be worth plannig to be around for one of those. Around GBP5/ Day</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/4311/arr/2015-06-17/ngt/3/ppl/1/#fullOverview">Okidoki Hostel</a> has great reviews and comes in at around EUR14/ night. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/6037/arr/2015-06-17/ngt/3/ppl/1/#fullOverview">Tatamka Hostel</a> looks a bit quieter and has kitchen, outdoor area and barbeque. Also comes in at around EUR14/ night.</p>

<p><a name="riga"></a> </p>

<h1>Riga (Latvia)</h1>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>At this point my carefully polished Eurolines bus plan has collapsed completely. Options include &quot;get some trains&quot; and &quot;walk&quot;. It&#39;ll be fine. Given that several sites recommend &quot;going via Russia&quot; and flying is only around Â£60, flying is a definite possibility.</p>

<h2>Seeing</h2>

<p>St.Peterâs churchâs tower in the Old Town is meant to be a great place to get panoramas of the city.</p>

<p>Riga Black Balsam Bar in the Old Town serves a traditional drink called, oddly, Riga Black Balsam which is an alcoholic drink one should apparently not leave without trying.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/latvia/riga/sights/landmarks-monuments/freedom-monument">Freedom Monument</a> which somehow avoided demolition during the Soviet years.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/latvia/riga/sights/museums-galleries/riga-motor-museum">Riga Motor Museum</a> for exhibits like Stalin&#39;s 7 tonne armored limousine.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/latvia/riga/activities/other/regro-s">Regros</a> a Soviet Fallout shelter where you can fire guns. What&#39;s not to love?</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p>My home in London (Techhub) has an <a href="https://riga.techhub.com/">office in Riga</a>, so there&#39;s no competition here.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/3512/arr/2015-06-17/ngt/2/ppl/1/">The Naughty Squirrel Backpackers</a>. They had me at the name but as if more was needed, to quote their about page: &quot;Daily activities include AK Shooting, Bobsled, Free Walking Tours, Pub Crawls, Latvian Food Nights, Karaoke, Husky Dog Sledding, Daily Happy Hours, Latvian Beer Tastings&quot;. Expensive at EUR17/ night. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/property/prp/97531/arr/2015-06-17/ngt/2/ppl/1/">Seagulls Garret Hostel</a> also looks promising and is a much easier 9EUR/ night.</p>

<p><a name="tallinn"></a> </p>

<h1>Tallinn (Estonia)</h1>

<h2>Arriving</h2>

<p>And we&#39;re back in the game (of getting buses everywhere that is). <a href="http://www.luxexpress.eu/en/tallinn-riga">Lux Express</a> takes 4 and a half hours to get from Riga to Tallinn, it only costs EUR16 and there are several per day. Luxury.</p>

<h2>Seeing</h2>

<p>My Tallinn expert is the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/GPat_UK">@GPat_Uk</a> who suggests:</p>

<p>For dinner - the Nordic hotel has the most ridiculous food. Like Michelin-star esque and not very expensive.</p>

<p>Elephant - good Indian</p>

<p>Pepparsack - GREAT meat and sometimes swordfighting</p>

<p>Make sure to drink a millimailakas</p>

<h2>Working</h2>

<p><a href="http://hub.garage48.org/">Garage48</a> comes in at a bargain EUR6/ day.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coworking.ee/">http://www.coworking.ee/</a> is just EUR5/ Day and the pictures include a typewriter. Touch choice.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.tallinnbackpackers.com/">Tallin Backpackers</a> (<a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/hostels/estonia/tallinn/31456/">hostel bookers</a>) is recommended by Nomadic Matt.</p>

<p><a href="http://euphoria.traveller.ee/">Euphoria</a> also looks promising for a more relaxed stay.</p>

<p>Location: The Flying Pig Uptown, Amsterdam<br/>
Status: Alive<br/>
Trip: <a href="/travel/2015-europe-trip-plan/">Europe Summer 2015</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s always a good sign when a trip begins by losing just one shoe the day before leaving. Armed with what I&#39;m rapidly realising are a not so serviceable pair from Tesco&#39;s for a bargain Â£12, it continued none the less.</p>

<p>Lesson&#39;s were learned almost immediately. Who knew you were supposed to check in for a coach?</p>

<p>Luckily, the emergency &quot;we need to to check in incredibly quickly because the [insert transport method] we&#39;re aiming for is pulling away/ taking off/ sinking&quot; queue is where all of the interesting people are. Here, along with a boarding pass (for a coach? really?), I found a Polish man who shared my love of Aldous Huxley and tepid wine. This promised to be a good journey.</p>

<p>We eventually reached the channel for the ferry crossing and I assembled my customary &quot;bed&quot; out of bar stools, purchased what I&#39;m promised started as a sausage roll and settled in to nap and watch Mash.</p>

<p>Exactly what transpired while I was napping is unclear but I understand it involved my new Polish friend and a litre bottle of Jagermeister. It seems even the Polish can&#39;t drink a litre of Jagermeister emerge unscathed. I believe the remainder of his trip was completed with some assistance from the emergency services. But he did know his Huxley.</p>

<p>One glorious visit to a closed service station later and we made it to Amsterdam. Well somewhere about 30km outside of Amsterdam but beggars and choosers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m now perched in the hostel overlooking Vondelpark, surrounded by Germans, and suitably impressed with the wine list:</p>

<p>Location: An AirBnB, Prague<br/>
Status: Eaten a lot of ham<br/>
Trip: <a href="/travel/2015-europe-trip-plan/">Europe Summer 2015</a></p>

<p>Amsterdam&#39;s cuisine is exactly what you&#39;d expect for one of the few cities in the world to legalise smoking cannabis. Bitterbollen is a wonderful thing but it&#39;s hard to imagine it being created by somebody not under the influence of something stronger than alcohol.</p>

<p>Prague serves exactly the food you&#39;d expect in a country where the average daily alcohol intake for an adult is 1.5litres of beer. And that&#39;s real beer, not American beer.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/prague/goulash.jpg" alt="Goulash"></p>

<p>This intake may explain why some interactions with the Czech&#39;s can be somewhat stilted, they&#39;re in the throws of a multi year hangover. As our tour guide explained &quot;have you experienced Czech service yet? They don&#39;t hate you, they&#39;re just...Czech.&quot;</p>

<p>On arrival I learned the hard way that &quot;not city center&quot; displayed on the side of a bus means &quot;this bus will go directly to the depot, turn all its lights off and the driver will then go to sleep&quot;.</p>

<p>After some public transport gymnastics and a not entirely intentional walk along the river, I arrived. Feeling good on a solid one hours sleep, 3 Bitterbollen and a Berroca, the hostel directed me to a local restaurant.</p>

<p>Czech food was created for people who were tired, hungover or had recently been subjected to an Easyjet flight. Most things seem to be variations on stews except for the ones which are giant plates of meat. And it&#39;s incredible.</p>

<p>A meal will cost something between two and ten pounds. The price of beer decays exponentially as you move away from the center, peaking at around three pounds with the lowest I&#39;ve seen being about eighty pence. Admittedly that eighty pence was part way through an entirely accidental eight mile walk so I can&#39;t be sure I was still technically in Prague. The locals like to tell you that beer is cheaper than water, which would be funny but for it being fiscally accurate.</p>

<p>Once out of hand, Prague has now taken care of the bachelor party problem by only allowing them into Irish bars. Take a seat near (this is important, near - not in) an Irish bar, grab a beer and indulge in some old fashioned people watching. Once you&#39;ve had your fill, move twenty yards down the road and you&#39;re back to civilisation.</p>

<p>Prague castle is, to say the least, beautiful. If that wasn&#39;t reason enough to visit, it turns out that the spectacular lighting at night, was a <a href="http://praguerevue.com/ViewArticle?articleId=1759">gift from the Rolling Stones</a>.</p>

<p>This began with Jagger saying to President Havel in a bar &quot;Havel, you have such a beautiful castle up there, but you can hardly see it at night.&quot; and the president responding that as a young country, they had higher priorities than lighting up their castle. $32,000 and some moonlighting from the bands lighting designer, and this was rectified.</p>

<p>Yesterday started off with what I can only describe of half a kilo of barbecued ham:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/prague/ham.jpg" alt="A lot of ham"></p>

<p>The resulting food coma meant spending several hours sitting on the edge of a square moving as little as humanly possible. Luckily the entertainment came to us. I&#39;ve no idea what we witnessed, but there was sword fighting:</p>

<p>Quote of the trip so far, aimed at me, around lunchtime; &quot;you haven&#39;t napped yet today, hopefully you won&#39;t be awake much longer&quot;.</p>

<p>Location: An AirBnB, Prague<br/>
Status: Eaten a lot of ham<br/>
Trip: <a href="/travel/2015-europe-trip-plan/">Europe Summer 2015</a></p>

<p>The Czech&#39;s truly have turned drinking into an art form, or more specifically, into a sport.</p>

<p>Introducing &quot;The Pub&quot;. It&#39;s a lot like a regular Pub in many respects, there is beer, food and people drink said beer.</p>

<p>It departs from normalcy shortly afterwards. Each table is equipped with four &quot;pour your own&quot; beer pumps. Before pouring, you select the name of the drinker to ensure the volume poured is attributed correctly.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/prague/pumps.jpg" alt="Pour your own beer"></p>

<p>This naturally requires a leader board to track total
consumption. But the Czech&#39;s, who I&#39;m growing to truly love, have taken it one step further.</p>

<p>Projected onto the wall is not just a table by table leader board, but a city by city one.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/prague/leaderboard.jpg%22" alt="Drinking leaderboard"></p>

<p>Two important lessons were learned whilst indulging in this so called
sport:</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually very difficult to pull a pint which isn&#39;t entirely
foam</p>

<ol>
<li>Two Londoners are highly unlikely to secure a place on a leader
board when competing against groups of 6+ Czechs</li>
<li>My favorite part of Prague is still by far the Old Town Square.
Touristy but beautiful. It&#39;s by far the most expensive place to grab a
beer but the sunsets make it worthwhile:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/prague/sunset.jpg" alt="Sunset"></p>

<p>And if that&#39;s not enough, there&#39;s an extremely talented Polish man who
waits until shortly after sunset to play with fire:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/prague/fire.jpg" alt="Fire show"></p>

<p>Having reluctantly bidden farewell to Prague, I&#39;m writing this on what I
can only describe as a hybrid between a train and and a sauna. We could
be in Bratslava but it&#39;s tough to be sure.</p>

<p>The &quot;travel everywhere by bus&quot; plan is largely falling by the wayside.
Trains seem to cost barely more and depart far more frequently.
Although I&#39;ll reserve judgment until this one arrives somewhere
recognisable.</p>

<p><em>Continued 04/06</em></p>

<p>Trains are winning, now safely in Budapest. The day began with a run
along the Danube followed by finding one of the friendliest co-working
spaces I&#39;ve ever encountered.</p>
