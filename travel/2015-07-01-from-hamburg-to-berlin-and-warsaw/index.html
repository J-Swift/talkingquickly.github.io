        <section class="post-content">
            <p>For anyone confused by the title I suggest reading this with Infernal - From Paris to Berlin playing. You&#39;re welcome.</p>

<p>After a brief pit stop in London to replace my lost possessions, Hamburg was supposed to be a quiet night with some sightseeing the next day. 2 hours later I was being taught what may be the most complex card game I&#39;ve ever encountered.</p>

<p>The name eludes me, as do most of the rules, I think it was Argentinian. It&#39;s played in two rounds, using the entire deck except 8&#39;s and 10&#39;s and involves adding something to something then taking away the number you first thought of. I did not win. Or perhaps I did it. We&#39;ll never know.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/hamburg/cards.jpg" alt="The most complicated card game ever"></p>

<p>My suggestion of an early night was predictably greeted with skepticism, &quot;you&#39;re here for only one night? Then we&#39;re going to Reeperbahn&quot;. I knew I was going to get on with this guy when we walked past a bar playing &quot;Johhny B. Goode&quot; and we simultaneously shouted &quot;Back To The Future&quot;. Of course we went in.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s possible to be less like the clientelle a bar is hoping for. The music was coming from a live band which took up the entire floor. Excluding us, everyone there was wearing a lot of leather, studs, had long hair and was about 7ft5. Ordering anything other than beer was met with confusion and I&#39;m not entirely sure they appreciated our dancing.</p>

<p>I believe we were the only none musicians there, after every song somebody else would come up to take over an instrument or the microphone. They could really play.</p>

<p>After what can only be described as a somewhat late finish, the only logical thing to do was get a 9AM train to Berlin the next morning.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing quite like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/berlin/breakfast.jpg" alt="The most complicated card game ever"></p>

<p>To perk you up when you realise you&#39;ve somehow forgotten to eat for the previous 18 hours. I also strongly recommend the view from the top of the parliament building, it&#39;s free but requires booking in advance. If anyone can tell me how they close the roof, I&#39;ll buy you a beer.</p>

<p>I was hoping to fall in love with Berlin, so many of my friends seem to have and it&#39;s the startup capital of Europe after London. The street art is incredible, as oddly was the vietnamese food. But it didn&#39;t have the same buzz I found in places like Budapest.</p>

<p>This may not be entirely fair though - I met friends there so did less of the #hostellife, #travelling stuff than usual. I also didn&#39;t visit any co-working spaces or try out the famous all night clubs. So I&#39;ll definitely be heading back for a week or two later this year. </p>

<p>Completely exhausted I headed to Warsaw. I had a brief moment of panic as the train pulled in, there seemed to be a lot of concrete. I&#39;m not a huge fan of concrete.</p>

<p>This turned out to be completely unjustified. Stepping out of the station to see this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/warsaw/culture.jpg" alt="The palace of culture"></p>

<p>Is something special. Admittidly it did remind me slightly of the Ministry of Truth from 1984, but in a good way... Several people have said Warsaw reminds them of Chicago. I was skeptical but can now see where they&#39;re coming from, especially some of the newer syscrapers could have been taken straight from the windy city.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/travel/warsaw/skyscrapers.jpg" alt="The palace of culture"></p>

<p>Five days is a ridiculous short duration to try and understand anything of the local culture, but there was definitely a theme. Lots of people seemed, for want of a better word, gruff, when I first met them. A few minutes of conversation, or however long until they first laughed and they would become some of the most friendly, helpful people I&#39;ve encountered.</p>

<p>Nights out in Warsaw are predictably cheap. A beer in the hostel was about 1 Euro and in a regular bar about 2 Euros. The only remotely expensive moment was the all gentleman of the party being charged club entry. Thinking about it, this may just have been a surcharge because of our shoes. That was justified.</p>

<p>You can get a train to anywhere from Warsaw. As long as it&#39;s Berlin, Prague or Vienna. Having come from Berlin and visited Prague three weeks ago, my decision was fairly easy. I&#39;m at least 90% sure I now have a one way ticket to Vienna.</p>
